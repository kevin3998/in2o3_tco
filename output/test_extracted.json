A R T I C L E I N F O 1. Introduction Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films with low resistivity and high transmittance properties attracted strong attention for its wide application in light emitting diodes, liquid crystal displays and solar cells [1–3]. In particular, TCO have been applied in silicon heterojunctions (SHJ) solar cells in order to improve the anti-reflection and lateral carrier transport [4–6]. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films fabricated by magnetron sputtering were commonly used as TCO in SHJ solar cells [7]. However, ITO films were limited because of low transmittance in the near-infrared (NIR) region caused by free carrier absorption (FCA) for their high carrier concentration [8]. In addition, the magnetron sputtering technique causes surface damages during the deposition processing which deteriorated the device performance [9]. Many deposition techniques have been used to obtain TCO films, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) [10], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [11], * Corresponding author.

Among these techniques, the ion energy during RPD coating is less than 30 eV, which can avoid damage to the substrate surface. It is well known that increasing the mobility instead of carrier concentration is an effective method to make TCO films more conductive without sacrificing transparency [14]. Massive effort has been devoted to achieving high-performance TCO films with single metal doping, such as tungsten-doped indium oxide [15], titanium-doped indium oxide [16] and cerium-doped indium oxide [17]. Recently, much attention has been paid to the co-doping process in which the two elements are doped into In2O3 simultaneously, because the co-doped In2O3 films are expected to show significant improvements in electrical and optical properties [18]. Since Ti and W ion size are smaller than that of In ions (Ti4+: 60 p.m., W6+: 62 p.m. and In3+: 80 p.m.), therefore Ti and W ions have a high electron mobility without lattice distortion [19]. Additionally, Ti and W atoms act as donors by providing more free electrons when doped into a In2O3 lattice [20]. Therefore, co-doping with Ti and W has the potential to improve the structural and electrical properties of indium oxide film [21]. Up to now, no investigation on the optoelectrical properties of IWTO films and the application of IWTO films on the SHJ solar cells has been reported. In this work, ~100-nm-thick Ti and W doped In2O3 (IWTO) films were fabricated with various oxygen flow rates (FO2) via low-damage RPD technique at room temperature (RT) or 150 ◦C heating temperature (HT) followed by air annealing. We have examined the effect of the O2-low (FO2 < 20 sccm), O2-medium (20 sccm ≤FO2 ≤40 sccm), O2- high (FO2 > 40 sccm) and substrate temperature in deposition processing on the structural, electrical, and optical properties of the IWTO films after annealing. Comparative studies of these films revealed the relationship between structure, optical, and electrical properties. It was found that the high-performance IWTO films can be obtained by optimizing substrate temperature and FO2. Finally, we demonstrate a high conversion efficiency of SHJ solar cells with the implementation of IWTO films as TCO. 2. Experiment To study the electrical and optical properties, IWTO films were deposited onto glass substrates (Corning 7059) by RPD (PCS4/CK, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd) at RT or HT condition with various FO2. The dimensions of RPD chamber are about 50 × 50 × 50 cm3. During the film deposition, the current and voltage of RPD system is set about 145.0 A and 18.0 V, respectively. Before various gases entered the process chamber, the vacuum pressure was set to ~4 × 10−4 Pa. Pure Ar (99.999%) with a fixed flow rate of 100 sccm and O2 (99.9998%) with varied FO2 from 10 to 80 sccm were induced into the chamber to maintain the total gas pressure at about 0.4 Pa. The source materials for deposition in this study were IWTO ceramic target (Enam Optoelectronic material Co., Ltd) which was made of indium oxide doped by 1.1 wt% WO3 and 0.05 wt% TiO2 with purity of 99.99%. The thickness of the IWTO films was approximately fixed at 100 nm by controlling the speed of the sample tray. All the as-deposited films were annealed at 200 ◦C in an air atmosphere for 30 min to match with metallization process during cell fabrication. The corresponding SHJ cell with IWTO film as TCO were fabricated to investigate the influence of various FO2 on device performance. The structure of SHJ solar cell consist of Ag metal grid/IWTO/a-Si:H(n)/a-Si: H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/IWTO/Ag metal grid. For the standard cell, 156 × 156 mm2 n-type Czochralski c-Si wafer (resistivity: 1–5 Ω cm; thickness: 150 μm) was used as substrates. Before deposition by plasma- enhance chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, 13.6 MHz), the c-Si substrates were etched in potassium hydroxide to obtain a random-pyramid surface texture, then cleaned by standard RCA processes. To remove the native oxide layer, the wafer was dipped in 3–5% hydrofluoric acid for 1 min. Subsequently, intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer stacked by n-type amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(n)) contact layer was deposited on the front, and a-Si:H(i) stacked by p-type amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(p)) was deposited on the rear side of c-Si wafer by PECVD reactor, in order to take the advantage of rear-emitter SHJ solar cell structure design [22]. 70–80 nm IWTO films was then deposited on both sides using RPD technique, where FO2 of front-side IWTO was varied from 10 to 80 sccm and that of rear-side IWTO was fixed at 40 sccm. All the function layers were optimized at device level to yield a high efficiency SHJ solar cell, and more details can be found in our previous papers [23–25]. Finally, silver electrodes were screen-printed on both sides of IWTO films, followed by curing 30 min at 200 ◦C to form contacts. The thickness of IWTO films were measured via a spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE, J.A Woollan Co., Inc. M −2000) with Drude and Tauc- Lorentz model. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200/PC) was applied to characterize the crystalline structure of IWTO films with Cu- Kα radiation source (k = 1.5405 Å) and 2θ scan mode, with the diffraction angle ranging from 10 to 80◦. The surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Merlin Compact), whereas the chemical state analysis of the elements within IWTO films was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI–5000C). Uv–Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) was used to obtain optical transmission and reflection spectra at wavelengths of 300–2500 nm. The transmittance and refection of films were characterized by eliminating the influence of the bare- glass substrate. The electrical carrier, electrical mobility, and resistivity were evaluated by Hall measurement at room temperature with van der Pauw method via an Ecopia HMS-5300 system. Sinton Consulting WCT- 120 system were used to acquire pseudo fill factor (pFF) of these SHJ cells. The I–V characteristic of SHJ cells were measured using a solar simulator (100 mW/cm2) under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25 ◦C). Fig. 1.

Crystallite structure The XRD patterns of IWTO films deposited at RT or HT with varied FO2 are shown in Fig. 1, while the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of preferential plane of various IWTO films are reported in Table 1. All the films exhibited a dominant (222) peak, while the (400) peak shows higher intensity as FO2 increases from O2-low to O2-medium, followed by a decrease with further increasing FO2 to O2-high. The IWTO film fabricated at O2-medium condition is polycrystalline with two dominant peaks at (222) and (400). The lower peak intensity of RT films than HT films indicates lower degree of crystallinity and higher proportion of amorphous components of RT films. Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 1 that the value of FWHM first decreases from O2-low to O2-medium and then increases with FO2 increasing to O2-high both at RT or HT condition, indicating that the crystallite size reaches largest at O2-medium. Therefore, it can be inferred that O2-medium with higher substrate temperature, which enhances the surface diffusion of radicals, lead to better crystallinity [26]. Fig. 2.

Surface morphology Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of three kinds of IWTO films (O2-low, O2-medium, and O2-high) deposited at RT or HT. All the films are polycrystalline (marked in figure by white circle), but the films with O2- medium present less grain boundaries than that of O2-low and O2-high for both RT and HT condition. The films deposited at RT condition exhibited partly amorphous and include large number of crystallite grains inside. In contrast, the HT films with different oxygen flow rates showed better higher degree of crystallinity compared to the RT state, which corresponds well with XRD peak intensity. 3.3. Chemical state analysis of IWTO films In order to investigate the surface chemical binding energy in IWTO films, XPS spectra of O2-medium film deposited at HT state were recorded and shown in Fig. 3. XPS characterizations have been conducted in vacuum after etching the surface with at least 10 nm to remove contaminants. At first, the wide scan XPS spectra of IWTO films (Fig. 3 (a)) reveals that the signals correspond to the In 3d, W 4f, and O 1s were found close to 450 eV, 37 eV, and 530 eV respectively [27–29]. The binding energies of 444.1 eV for the In 3d3/2 and 451.7 eV for the In 3d5/2 were observed in Fig. 3 (b); these related to the binding energies of the In3+ ion in In2O3 [27]. In Fig. 3 (c), the 4f spectrum consists of a double with binding energies of 35.7 eV and 37.5 eV correspond to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 which confirms the formation of W–O bond by W6+ ions [28]. Hence, the trivalent In was substituted by hexavalent W in IWTO, which provides excess carriers. In O1s spectra (Fig. 3 (d)), the sharp peak at 529.7 eV (peak A) attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen and confirms the existence of O in O2−state, while the higher peak at 530.5 eV (peak B) is assigned to the O atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy (Vo) [30]. Also, it is expected that the oxygen vacancies might improve the conductivity of IWTO film. Although it is hard to find the relevant peak in the XPS spectra due to low Ti content (0.05 wt%), Ti doping indeed improved the electrical properties of IWTO films as shown in Fig. S1. 3.4. Electrical properties and optical properties Fig. 4 shows the change in carrier concentration (N), carrier mobility (μ), and resistivity (ρ) for the IWTO deposited at RT or HT with various FO2 in the as-deposited and annealed state. As observed in Fig. 4 (a), the N of as-deposited film with O2-low is very high due to the substitution of In3+ by W6+ and Ti4+ and high concentration of O vacancies, which generate more excess electrons into the conduction band [20]. It is seen that N substantially decreases with increasing FO2, which is attributed to the occupation of oxygen vacancy (Vo) by more oxygen from reactive plasmas. Besides, after annealing, the oxygen came from air atmosphere further reduce the N of films. As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the μ of the IWTO films first increases with the increasing of FO2 from O2-low to O2-medium, then decreases and saturates at O2-high. The carrier mobility is related to the scattering mechanisms, especially the ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary Fig. 4. (a) Carrier concentration, (b) carrier mobility, and (c) resistivity as function of oxygen flow rate for the IWTO films. Fig. 5. Optical transmittance and reflectivity spectra of IWTO films with various FO2 deposited at (a) RT and (b) HT. W. Huang et al. Journal of Power Sources 506 (2021) 230101 5 scattering [31]. The decreasing N with increasing FO2 (Fig. 4 (a)) results in decreased ionic impurity scattering, contributing to higher mobility. In addition, the O2-medium films deposited at HT show better crystallization and larger grain size after annealing process (described in section 3.1 & 3.2) which leads to reduced grain boundary scattering [32]. As a result of decreased ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering, IWTO films with O2-medium shows a notably high mobility up to 92.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and therefore the lowest resistivity of 2.13 × 10−4 Ω cm after annealing. Fig. 5 displays the transmittance (T) and reflection (R) of IWTO films with various oxygen deposited at RT and HT in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm, it is observed that the changes in optical properties are very similar for the films deposited at RT and HT. The R of IWTO films increased with the increasing of FO2 in the entire wavelength range. In the short wavelength and near inferred region (NIR), the T was increased with increasing of FO2 due to substantially decreasing carrier concentration and hence reduced free carrier absorption [33]. However, the T of O2-medium films is higher than that of O2-low and O2-high in the visible light and short NIR, which is ascribed to the improvement of crystalline quality with fewer lattice disorder [34]. The average T, R, and absorption (A, calculated by 1-T-R) in the range of 400–1200 nm (absorption spectrum range of solar cell) were shown in Table 2. It is seen that the A sharply decreases with increasing of FO2 from 10 sccm to 20 sccm and then decreases gently with further increasing FO2 for both condition of RT or HT. Except for O2-low, the changes in absorption is very small with varied FO2. 3.5. SHJ solar cells with IWTO films as front TCO According to the above analysis of structural, optical, and electrical properties of IWTO films under various condition, the film of HT condition was applied to SHJ cells. Cells fabricated at FO2 of 10 sccm show a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) due to significantly higher A. A sharp increase in Jsc from 35 to 38.5 mA cm−2 was observed with increasing FO2 from 10 to 20 sccm due to decreasing A and then Jsc tends to saturate as the A are very close with further increasing FO2, as shown in Table 2. Both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and pFF remains almost unchanged with varied FO2, as shown in Fig. 6 (b) and (c) respectively, suggesting comparable passivation quality. These results indicate that RPD has negligible damage at the a-Si/c-Si interface, excluding the influence of carrier recombination loss on fill factor (FF). Consequently, changes in FF can be attributed to resistive losses. As shown in Fig. 6 (c), FF first increase and then decreases with FO2, which corresponds well with the parabolic change of TCO resistivity in Fig. 4 (c). A low TCO resistivity of 2.13 × 10−4 Ω cm due to high mobility was obtained at optimized O2-medium condition, giving rise to reduced resistive losses and hence highest FF of 82.9%. Finally, we demonstrate high- performance, IWTO-implemented SHJ solar cells with Jsc of 38.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.746 V, FF of 82.9% and efficiency up to 23.8%. 4. Conclusion In this paper, IWTO films with varied FO2 were fabricated at RT or HT by low-damage RPD technique followed by air atmosphere annealing. Titanium and Tungsten co-doped thin films provide more carriers due to the substitution of In3+ by W6+ and Ti4+ without lattice distortion. As FO2 increases, the N sustainably decreases as a result of the occupation of oxygen vacancies. It was found that optimized FO2 condition at O2-medium results in the highest carrier mobility due to improved crystalline quality with decreased grain boundary scattering, giving rise to the lowest resistivity of 2.13 × 10−4 Ω cm. Additionally, a high average Table 2 The average T, R, and A in the range of 400–1200 nm of IWTO films with various FO2 deposited at RT or HT state.

SHJ solar cells with highest FF was achieved at O2-medium condition at heating temperature, which shows better optoelectrical properties than room temperature, due to ultralow resistivity of IWTO films. Finally, we demonstrated large-scale SHJ solar cell (243.34 cm2) with a high conversion efficiency of 23.8% with the implementation of IWTO films. The findings prove that IWTO films have great potential for applications in SHJ solar cells and other type of solar cells which require highly transparent and high-mobility TCO films.

Herein, hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Ga-doped indium oxide (IMO:H) films are explored and the structural and optical-electrical characteristics were optimized with the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen and total gas flow rate. IMO:H films exhibit preferential orientation growth in <100> direction and a distinct shift to higher 2θ with the addition hydrogen is observed due to the size mismatch between doped ions and In ions. Furthermore, the carrier concentration of IMO:H films is decreased due to the substitution of oxygen vacancies by hydrogen, leading to the decrement of free carrier absorption and a 1.25%abs increase of effective total transmittance is obtained in the region from 600 to 1200 nm. Additionally, the mobility of IMO:H films enhances to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with optimized resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm ascribing to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers provided by oxygen vacancies. When using IMO:H films as rear electrode in industrial solar cells, a 0.35 mA/cm2 absolute increase of average JSC and a 0.33%abs increase in average fill factor is acquired, respectively. Finally, an average PCE gain of 0.18%abs is come through and the champion cell shows PCE of 23.81 %.

Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have attracted considerable interest among high-efficiency photovoltaic devices due to their high open-circuit voltage (VOC), low temperature process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) [1]. A word record PCE of 26.8 % for SHJ solar cells on M6 wafers with VOC up to 751.4 mV was achieved by LONGi in 2022 [2]. However, there is still a gap existed with respect to short-circuit current density (JSC) when compared to tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) solar cells. The parasitic absorption of window layers such as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in SHJ solar cells hinders the improvement of JSC and the use of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) rather than a-Si:H could potentially provide an additional gain in JSC [3]. Besides, as the first window layer of SHJ solar cells, it is essential to explore and develop TCO films with better optical and electrical properties. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been commonly used in SHJ solar cells [4], while their optical performance has been restricted in the * Corresponding author.

Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, a feasible approach to achieve the best balance between electrical and optical properties of TCO films is to enhance carrier mobility and to reduce free carrier concentration at the same time. Numerous efforts have been used to obtain high mobility TCO films and metallic cations used as dopants in In2O3 films is demonstrated to be an effective way [6–8]. Several studies investigated that high Lewis acid dopants could suppress scattering centers hence enhancing the mobility [9,10]. Transition metal dopants (W6+, Mo6+, Zr4+, Ti4+) possess higher Lewis acid strengths than Sn4+ ions in In2O3-based films and presents high carrier mobility exceeding 80 cm2V−1s−1 [11–15]. Ga dopants in In2O3 lattice cannot be ionized impurity scattering centers and are known to be carrier suppressor [16]. However, most of these high performance films require high-temperature preparation or post thermal treatment, which is not compatible with the production of SHJ solar cells. Recently, much attention has been paid to co-doping and multiple-doping processes in which two or more metallic cations are doped into In2O3 films simultaneously to realize high mobility TCO films at lower temperature [17–20]. In addition, it is reported that hydrogen impurities in In2O3 play the role of shallow donors whether interstitial hydrogen or substitutional hydrogen [21], and some reports suggest that hydrogen introduced into process gases could be an effective way for In2O3-based thin films to alter electrical properties [18,22,23]. Up to now, only few investigations are available for hydrogenated multiple doped In2O3 films and their application in SHJ solar cells. Direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method is one of the most used deposition technique to obtain high-quality TCO films [24]. The optical-electrical properties of the films are sensitive to the sputtering parameters, such as sputtering power and deposition temperature [25, 26]. It is worth mention that variation of total gas flow rate under the same pressure is an effective way to moderate pumping speed, which may in turn imposes alteration on process gases concentration in chamber and consequently affects the properties of TCO [27,28]. However, the effects of total gas flow rate on the performance of multiple doped In2O3 films has not been fully explored. In this work, ~100-nm-thick hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 (IMO:H) films were deposited with various gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and different total gas flow rate (Fgas) via DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature followed by 200 ◦C air annealing, and detailed information about this material could be found in our previous study [29]. The structural, electrical and optical properties of the IMO:H films were systematically investigated. It was found that high performance W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 films could be obtained by optimizing fH2 and Fgas, and we applied these films as front TCO or rear TCO in SHJ solar cells. Finally, we demonstrate that higher PCE of SHJ solar cells can be come through with the implementation of IMO:H films as rear transparent electrode. 2. Experiment In the experiment, the IMO:H films were prepared onto glass substrates (Corning 7059) by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The background pressure was pumped to 9 × 10−4 Pa before process gases entered the chamber. The sputtering power was 120 W with power density of 0.66 W/cm2. The introduced gases were argon (Ar), oxygen (O2) and the mixture of hydrogen and argon (Ar + H2, H2 was 0.5 % diluted in Ar). The gas flow rate ratio of oxygen fO2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was kept constant at 2 % and the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 = [Ar + H2] × 0.5 %/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was varied from 0 % to 0.2 %, where the [Ar], [O2] and [Ar + H2] were the gas flow rate of Ar, O2 and mixture of Ar and H2. The total gas flow rate Fgas = [O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2] was under 50 sccm (L- Fgas). Besides, the film preparation at 0.2 % fH2 was also deposited under Fgas of 100 sccm (H- Fgas). The chamber pressure was manually kept at 0.45 Pa during the process and we opened the valve to increase effective pumping speed to maintain the pressure at high total gas flow rates. The ceramic target in this study was made of indium oxide doped by 0.3 wt% WO3, 0.5 wt% MoO3, 0.6 wt% TiO2, 1.0 wt% ZrO2, and 0.6 wt% Ga2O3 with a purity of 99.99 %, provided by Luoyang Jinglian Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. The thickness of the IMO:H films was about 100 nm and all samples were annealed at 200 ◦C in air atmosphere for 30 min. To investigate the influence of IMO:H films on device performance under various process conditions, the corresponding single-sided rear- emitter IMO:H film SHJ solar cells were fabricated on 156 mm × 156 mm n-type Czochralski c-Si wafers (thickness, 150 μm; resistivity, 1–5 Ω). Firstly, these wafers were etched in potassium hydroxide (KOH) to obtain pyramid surface texture, followed by the standard RCA processes. Then the wafers were dipped in 3–5 % hydrofluoric acid for 1 min. Later, these wafers were transferred to PECVD chambers to deposit intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer and doped nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H(n/p)) contact layer to form a structure of nc-Si:H (n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-Si:H(p). Subsequently, all wafers were divided into two groups, front-side groups had IMO:H films on the front side and ITO films on the rear side, the other group is rear-side groups with ITO films on the front side and IMO:H films on the rear side. The thickness of ITO films was the same as IMO:H films, and the IMO:H films were deposited under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. Finally, silver electrodes were screen-printed on both sides, followed by 30-min annealing at 200 ◦C. The thickness and optical constant of IMO:H films were extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE, J.A Woollan Co., Inc. M _ 2000) with Tauc-Lorentz and Drude model. The crystalline structure information was obtained via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200/PC) with Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15405 nm) and θ-2θ scan mode, with the diffraction angle ranging from 20 to 70◦. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI–5000C) was used to analysis the chemical state of the elements within IMO:H films. The electrical properties were monitored by Hall-effect measurement at room temperature by Ecopia HMS-5300 system. A Uv–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) was utilized to acquire optical transmission and reflection spectra at a wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm. All the films were characterized with glass substrate. The I–V characteristic of SHJ cells were measured using a solar simulator (100 mW/cm2) under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25 ◦C). Sinton WCT-120, with quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurement, was used to measure effective carrier lifetime (τeff). 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Crystallite structure The XRD patterns of IMO:H films under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the films well match with the typical cubic In2O3 powder data (JCPDS No.06-0416), indicating that low doping content of cation dopants does not cause additional phase. The intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) is larger than the standard values of In2O3 powder data (0.3) as shown in Fig. 1(b), manifesting a preferential orientation growth in the <100> direction. Fig. 1(c) depicts that the peak position of (400) diffraction peak is slightly shifted to larger angle with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 %, indicating a contraction in the lattice constant owing to the occupation of hydrogen into oxygen sites in the In2O3 lattice [21]. However, the shift further to higher 2θ of the film deposited under H- Fgas may come from the reason that the intense gas flow direct to the substrate and heavy incorporation of smaller cation (W, Mo, Ti, Ga) into the In sites of the In2O3 lattice lead to lattice distortion caused by macroscopic residual stresses [30,31]. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 3 3.2. Chemical state analysis In order to probe the change of oxygen vacancy content and hydroxide species in IMO:H films, Fig. 2 illustrates the O1s core level peaks of XPS spectra for IMO:H films with different fH2 and different Fgas. The O1s peak can be fitted into three Gauss-Lorentz peaks with binding energy values of 529.6eV, 530.3eV and 531.8eV, respectively. Peak OA observed at the lowest binding energy at 529.6eV is related to the lattice oxygen attached to the metallic elements in the cubic In2O3 structure, while the peak at 530.3eV (OB) is ascribed to oxygen deficiency sites [32]. The area of OB is relevant to the concentration of free carriers generating by oxygen vacancies. The highest binding energy at 531.8eV (OC) corresponds to metal hydroxide peak [33]. The O1s core level peaks are fitted to investigated the relationship between the chemical states of Fig. 1. (a) XRD pattern of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. (b) Intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) of IMO:H films. (c) Enlarged (400) peak. Fig. 2.

(e) The estimated area ration of peak OB (calculated as OB/(OA + OB + OC)) and peak OC (calculated as OC/(OA + OB + OC)). S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 4 oxygen and different fH2 under different Fgas. The relative area ratios of peak OB and peak OC to all the three peaks, OB/(OA + OB + OC) and OC/(OA + OB + OC), are extracted from the fitted curves, where OA, OB, OC represents the area of peak OA, OB and OC, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e). A significant decrease of OB ratio with increasing the fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas is observed, accompanied by continuously increment of OC ratio, illustrating that the incorporation of H+ ions promote to bind to oxygen vacancies to be a donor or to form a number of hydroxyl groups due to the stabilization of hydrogen [34]. It is worth mentioning that the enhancement of Fgas at fH2 of 0.2 % leads to smaller OB and lager OC, meaning less oxygen vacancies and more hydroxyl formed at H- Fgas. 3.3. Electrical properties The electrical properties of the IMO:H films are analyzed by Hall- effect measurements. Fig. 3 shows the carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity of the films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. As observed in Fig. 3(a), the carrier concentration of the films decreases from 4.06 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.87 × 1020 cm−3 when fH2 increases from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas. The free carriers of the IMO:H films are mainly generated from oxygen vacancies (VO), hydrogen donors and metal substitution of In3+ by W6+, Mo6+, Ti4+, and Zr4+. From the XPS results (Fig. 2(e)), the OB ratio of the film without hydrogen having higher carrier concentration is apparently larger than the films deposited at higher fH2 and the change of OB is strongly correlated with VO. Consequently, it could be concluded that less VO is the main reason for the sharp decrease of carrier concentration in high fH2 preparing films, VO release two free electrons while H+ releases only one free electron. Furthermore, the carrier concentration reduced to 1.81 × 1020 cm−3 at H- Fgas. The fH2 obviously has an effect on the mobility of IMO:H films. The carrier mobility of IMO:H films firstly increases from 58.29 cm2V−1s−1 to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.1 % under L- Fgas. However, the mobility is down to ~34 cm2V−1s−1 when the film fabricated at fH2 of 0.2 %, whether under L- Fgas or H- Fgas. The change of mobility is relevant to scattering mechanisms, such as ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering [11]. The increasing mobility of IMO:H films is mainly related to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers served by oxygen vacancies, which could be confirmed from XPS results. However, the decline in mobility of the film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 may be attributed to defected grain boundaries, caused by the diffusion of H and OH intragrain species to the grain boundary and the formation of indium hydroxides at the grain boundary during annealing treatment [26]. Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, the IMO:H films with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas shows lowest resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm, while the film with 0.2 % fH2 deposited at H- Fgas shows highest resistivity of 1.02 × 10−3 Ω cm. 3.4. Optical properties In order to exclude the influence of reflection, the effective total transmittance (TTe) spectra are used to evaluate the absorption properties of IMO:H films. TTe is defined as [23]: TTe = T 1 −R (1) where T is the transmittance and R is the reflectance. Fig. 4 (a) displays the TTe and reflectance of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. It is clearly observed that increasing fH2 and Fgas enhances the transmittance of IMO:H films in the region from 600 nm to 1200 nm. The average TTe above 600 nm increases from 97.86 % to 98.86 % with an increasing fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % and the average TTe further increase to 99.11 % when deposited at H- Fgas. The variation of transmittance in the infrared wavelength region has strong correlation with free carrier absorption (FCA) [35]. The increase of fH2 and Fgas will reduce the carrier concentration, leading to the weakening of FCA effect, which is favorable to the transmittance of IMO:H films. The variation of reflectance is the same as the variation of TTe. Besides, Fig. 4 (b) presents the optical constants refractive index and extinction coefficient of IMO:H films. The refractive index of IMO:H films slightly increases by the increment of fH2 under L- Fgas. It is found that the refractive index increases with decreasing carrier concentration, which is consistent with previous reports in TCO films [36]. The film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas has the highest refractive index and lowest extinction coefficient. 3.5. SHJ performance According to the above research of structural, optical, and electrical properties of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas, we applied the film on SHJ solar cell’s front (n) and rear (p) side respectively and the other side deposited with ITO films, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows key parameters of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the front side. As expected, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of solar cells have been improved with hydrogenated films on the front side from 38.66 mA/cm2 to 39.14 mA/cm2. The enhancement of JSC of SHJ solar cells is ascribing to higher transmittance of hydrogenated films, and the highest JSC cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas have the highest TTe curve in Fig. 4 (a). Fig. 7 (a) displays the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these cells with non-hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and hydrogenated films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as front side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows an improvement above the wavelength of 500 nm, consistent with the result of improved JSC as shown in Fig. 6 (b). Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells with the addition of hydrogen at the stage of TCO preparation in Fig. 6 (a) is lower than the samples without hydrogen, considering that hydrogen radicals or ions generated in the plasma could etch the underlying layer at the beginning of TCO deposition, the effusion of hydrogen from underlying layer and generation of dangling bonds at a-Si:H(i)/Cz-Si interface could trigger the deterioration of the passivation quality [37]. It is well known that fill factor (FF) has strong relationship with series resistance (RS), the RS curve is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Since the increasing carrier concentration of TCO films leads to a reduction contact resistivity at the ITO/a-Si:H(n) interface as reported by C. Luderer [38], the deterioration of fill factor (FF) for SHJ solar cells with front hydrogenated films could be ascribed to the superposition of high contact resistances of IMO:H film/nc-Si(n) Fig. 3. Carrier concentration, mobility, and resistivity of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 5 contact and the resistivity of the IMO:H film itself. Finally, the average PCE up to 21.14 % is obtained with front IMO:H film solar cells when the film is deposited at 0 % fH2 under L- Fgas. Fig. 8 shows the performance of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the rear side. The JSC is the lowest of 38.79 mA/cm2 when the film fabricated without hydrogen under L- Fgas, while the highest JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 is obtained when the cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. Fig. 9 (a) displays the EQE of these cells with non- hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and IMO:H films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as rear side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows better spectral response in the wavelength from 1000 to 1200 nm. Since the solar spectrum reaching the rear side of SHJ cells are mainly composed of infrared light, the higher refractive index and reflectivity of IMO:H films under H- Fgas in the NIR region could Fig. 4. Optical (a) effective total transmittance and reflectance, (b) refractive index and extinction coefficient curves of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas.

Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 6 improve the scattering of light and support stronger spectral response, thereby enhancing the JSC [39]. FF first increases and then decreases with higher fH2 under L- Fgas and further decreases under H- Fgas, and the series resistance of solar cells shown in Fig. 9 (b) is consistent with the parabolic change of IMO:H films’ resistivity in Fig. 3. A low resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm is obtained with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas, leading to the highest FF of 82.18 %. It is well known that sputter damage has an impact on the performance of SHJ solar cells [40]. To investigate the impact of IMO:H sputtering on VOC, Fig. 10 shows the effective carrier lifetime (τeff) at the Fig. 7. (a) EQE curve of SHJ solar cells.

In our experiment, the thickness of n-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (n)) is about 20 nm, while the thickness of p-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (p)) is approximately 30 nm. The thickness of nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer has a certain effect on alleviating sputtering damage thinner nc-Si:H layer suffer severe sputtering damage. Vividly, the curing process recovers the sputter-induced degradation passivation for cells with IMO:H on rear side, while the passivation for cells with IMO:H on front side did not reach the initial state, leading to a generally lower VOC when IMO:H applied on the front side. In addition, unlike the performance of IMO:H used as front side, the flat variation in VOC shows that hydrogen treatment during the formation of rear side IMO:H does not erode passivation effect, which may attribute to 10 nm thicker nc-Si:H (p) layer conductive to moderate the destruction of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the degradation after hydrogen treatment sputtering is recovered after 200 ◦C curing. Finally, the champion solar cell with VOC of 744.45 mV, ISC of 38.93 A, FF of 82.18 % and PCE up to 23.81 % is obtained with rear IMO:H film deposited at 0.1 % fH2 under L- Fgas. 4. Conclusion In this study, high performance IMO:H films are fabricated by DC sputtering technique at room temperature, followed by 200 ◦C post- annealing. The structural, electrical and optical properties of IMO:H films has been investigated as a function of gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and total gas flow rate (Fgas). The experimental results indicate that all films feature preferential orientation (400) and lattice distortion is further aggravated under higher total gas flow rate. The addition of hydrogen in sputtering gases can enhance carrier mobility, and the film prepared with fH2 of 0.1 % at low total gas flow rate shows high mobility of 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with lowest resistivity of approximately 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm and relatively high transmittance in the wavelength range above 500 nm. When employing IMO:H films as transparent electrode in SHJ solar cells, the devices with hydrogenated films have higher JSC and the highest average JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 are obtained finally, ascribing to excellent optical performance. Besides, when IMO:H films are applied as the rear side of SHJ devices, the solar cells were achieved the maximum PCE of 23.81 %, and the average PCE is 0.18%abs improvement compared to non-hydrogen film. The findings prove that hydrogen doped In2O3 based films provide the possibility of application in SHJ solar cells or other optoelectronic devices which require high transmittance and high mobility TCO films.

Herein, hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Ga-doped indium oxide (IMO:H) films are explored and the structural and optical-electrical characteristics were optimized with the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen and total gas flow rate. IMO:H films exhibit preferential orientation growth in <100> direction and a distinct shift to higher 2θ with the addition hydrogen is observed due to the size mismatch between doped ions and In ions. Furthermore, the carrier concentration of IMO:H films is decreased due to the substitution of oxygen vacancies by hydrogen, leading to the decrement of free carrier absorption and a 1.25%abs increase of effective total transmittance is obtained in the region from 600 to 1200 nm.

Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have attracted considerable interest among high-efficiency photovoltaic devices due to their high open-circuit voltage (VOC), low temperature process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) [1]. A word record PCE of 26.8 % for SHJ solar cells on M6 wafers with VOC up to 751.4 mV was achieved by LONGi in 2022 [2]. However, there is still a gap existed with respect to short-circuit current density (JSC) when compared to tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) solar cells. The parasitic absorption of window layers such as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in SHJ solar cells hinders the improvement of JSC and the use of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) rather than a-Si:H could potentially provide an additional gain in JSC [3]. Besides, as the first window layer of SHJ solar cells, it is essential to explore and develop TCO films with better optical and electrical properties. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been commonly used in SHJ solar cells [4], while their optical performance has been restricted in the * Corresponding author.

Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, a feasible approach to achieve the best balance between electrical and optical properties of TCO films is to enhance carrier mobility and to reduce free carrier concentration at the same time. Numerous efforts have been used to obtain high mobility TCO films and metallic cations used as dopants in In2O3 films is demonstrated to be an effective way [6–8]. Several studies investigated that high Lewis acid dopants could suppress scattering centers hence enhancing the mobility [9,10]. Transition metal dopants (W6+, Mo6+, Zr4+, Ti4+) possess higher Lewis acid strengths than Sn4+ ions in In2O3-based films and presents high carrier mobility exceeding 80 cm2V−1s−1 [11–15]. Ga dopants in In2O3 lattice cannot be ionized impurity scattering centers and are known to be carrier suppressor [16]. However, most of these high performance films require high-temperature preparation or post thermal treatment, which is not compatible with the production of SHJ solar cells. Recently, much attention has been paid to co-doping and multiple-doping processes in which two or more metallic cations are doped into In2O3 films simultaneously to realize high mobility TCO films at lower temperature [17–20]. In addition, it is reported that hydrogen impurities in In2O3 play the role of shallow donors whether interstitial hydrogen or substitutional hydrogen [21], and some reports suggest that hydrogen introduced into process gases could be an effective way for In2O3-based thin films to alter electrical properties [18,22,23]. Up to now, only few investigations are available for hydrogenated multiple doped In2O3 films and their application in SHJ solar cells. Direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method is one of the most used deposition technique to obtain high-quality TCO films [24]. The optical-electrical properties of the films are sensitive to the sputtering parameters, such as sputtering power and deposition temperature [25, 26]. It is worth mention that variation of total gas flow rate under the same pressure is an effective way to moderate pumping speed, which may in turn imposes alteration on process gases concentration in chamber and consequently affects the properties of TCO [27,28]. However, the effects of total gas flow rate on the performance of multiple doped In2O3 films has not been fully explored. In this work, ~100-nm-thick hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 (IMO:H) films were deposited with various gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and different total gas flow rate (Fgas) via DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature followed by 200 ◦C air annealing, and detailed information about this material could be found in our previous study [29]. The structural, electrical and optical properties of the IMO:H films were systematically investigated. It was found that high performance W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 films could be obtained by optimizing fH2 and Fgas, and we applied these films as front TCO or rear TCO in SHJ solar cells. Finally, we demonstrate that higher PCE of SHJ solar cells can be come through with the implementation of IMO:H films as rear transparent electrode. 2. Experiment In the experiment, the IMO:H films were prepared onto glass substrates (Corning 7059) by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The background pressure was pumped to 9 × 10−4 Pa before process gases entered the chamber. The sputtering power was 120 W with power density of 0.66 W/cm2. The introduced gases were argon (Ar), oxygen (O2) and the mixture of hydrogen and argon (Ar + H2, H2 was 0.5 % diluted in Ar). The gas flow rate ratio of oxygen fO2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was kept constant at 2 % and the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 = [Ar + H2] × 0.5 %/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was varied from 0 % to 0.2 %, where the [Ar], [O2] and [Ar + H2] were the gas flow rate of Ar, O2 and mixture of Ar and H2. The total gas flow rate Fgas = [O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2] was under 50 sccm (L- Fgas). Besides, the film preparation at 0.2 % fH2 was also deposited under Fgas of 100 sccm (H- Fgas). The chamber pressure was manually kept at 0.45 Pa during the process and we opened the valve to increase effective pumping speed to maintain the pressure at high total gas flow rates. The ceramic target in this study was made of indium oxide doped by 0.3 wt% WO3, 0.5 wt% MoO3, 0.6 wt% TiO2, 1.0 wt% ZrO2, and 0.6 wt% Ga2O3 with a purity of 99.99 %, provided by Luoyang Jinglian Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. The thickness of the IMO:H films was about 100 nm and all samples were annealed at 200 ◦C in air atmosphere for 30 min. To investigate the influence of IMO:H films on device performance under various process conditions, the corresponding single-sided rear- emitter IMO:H film SHJ solar cells were fabricated on 156 mm × 156 mm n-type Czochralski c-Si wafers (thickness, 150 μm; resistivity, 1–5 Ω). Firstly, these wafers were etched in potassium hydroxide (KOH) to obtain pyramid surface texture, followed by the standard RCA processes. Then the wafers were dipped in 3–5 % hydrofluoric acid for 1 min. Later, these wafers were transferred to PECVD chambers to deposit intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer and doped nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H(n/p)) contact layer to form a structure of nc-Si:H (n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-Si:H(p). Subsequently, all wafers were divided into two groups, front-side groups had IMO:H films on the front side and ITO films on the rear side, the other group is rear-side groups with ITO films on the front side and IMO:H films on the rear side. The thickness of ITO films was the same as IMO:H films, and the IMO:H films were deposited under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. Finally, silver electrodes were screen-printed on both sides, followed by 30-min annealing at 200 ◦C. The thickness and optical constant of IMO:H films were extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE, J.A Woollan Co., Inc. M _ 2000) with Tauc-Lorentz and Drude model. The crystalline structure information was obtained via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200/PC) with Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15405 nm) and θ-2θ scan mode, with the diffraction angle ranging from 20 to 70◦. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI–5000C) was used to analysis the chemical state of the elements within IMO:H films. The electrical properties were monitored by Hall-effect measurement at room temperature by Ecopia HMS-5300 system. A Uv–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) was utilized to acquire optical transmission and reflection spectra at a wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm. All the films were characterized with glass substrate. The I–V characteristic of SHJ cells were measured using a solar simulator (100 mW/cm2) under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25 ◦C). Sinton WCT-120, with quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurement, was used to measure effective carrier lifetime (τeff). 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Crystallite structure The XRD patterns of IMO:H films under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the films well match with the typical cubic In2O3 powder data (JCPDS No.06-0416), indicating that low doping content of cation dopants does not cause additional phase. The intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) is larger than the standard values of In2O3 powder data (0.3) as shown in Fig. 1(b), manifesting a preferential orientation growth in the <100> direction. Fig. 1(c) depicts that the peak position of (400) diffraction peak is slightly shifted to larger angle with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 %, indicating a contraction in the lattice constant owing to the occupation of hydrogen into oxygen sites in the In2O3 lattice [21]. However, the shift further to higher 2θ of the film deposited under H- Fgas may come from the reason that the intense gas flow direct to the substrate and heavy incorporation of smaller cation (W, Mo, Ti, Ga) into the In sites of the In2O3 lattice lead to lattice distortion caused by macroscopic residual stresses [30,31]. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 3 3.2. Chemical state analysis In order to probe the change of oxygen vacancy content and hydroxide species in IMO:H films, Fig. 2 illustrates the O1s core level peaks of XPS spectra for IMO:H films with different fH2 and different Fgas. The O1s peak can be fitted into three Gauss-Lorentz peaks with binding energy values of 529.6eV, 530.3eV and 531.8eV, respectively. Peak OA observed at the lowest binding energy at 529.6eV is related to the lattice oxygen attached to the metallic elements in the cubic In2O3 structure, while the peak at 530.3eV (OB) is ascribed to oxygen deficiency sites [32]. The area of OB is relevant to the concentration of free carriers generating by oxygen vacancies. The highest binding energy at 531.8eV (OC) corresponds to metal hydroxide peak [33]. The O1s core level peaks are fitted to investigated the relationship between the chemical states of Fig. 1. (a) XRD pattern of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. (b) Intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) of IMO:H films. (c) Enlarged (400) peak. Fig. 2.

(e) The estimated area ration of peak OB (calculated as OB/(OA + OB + OC)) and peak OC (calculated as OC/(OA + OB + OC)). S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 4 oxygen and different fH2 under different Fgas. The relative area ratios of peak OB and peak OC to all the three peaks, OB/(OA + OB + OC) and OC/(OA + OB + OC), are extracted from the fitted curves, where OA, OB, OC represents the area of peak OA, OB and OC, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e). A significant decrease of OB ratio with increasing the fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas is observed, accompanied by continuously increment of OC ratio, illustrating that the incorporation of H+ ions promote to bind to oxygen vacancies to be a donor or to form a number of hydroxyl groups due to the stabilization of hydrogen [34]. It is worth mentioning that the enhancement of Fgas at fH2 of 0.2 % leads to smaller OB and lager OC, meaning less oxygen vacancies and more hydroxyl formed at H- Fgas. 3.3. Electrical properties The electrical properties of the IMO:H films are analyzed by Hall- effect measurements. Fig. 3 shows the carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity of the films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. As observed in Fig. 3(a), the carrier concentration of the films decreases from 4.06 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.87 × 1020 cm−3 when fH2 increases from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas. The free carriers of the IMO:H films are mainly generated from oxygen vacancies (VO), hydrogen donors and metal substitution of In3+ by W6+, Mo6+, Ti4+, and Zr4+. From the XPS results (Fig. 2(e)), the OB ratio of the film without hydrogen having higher carrier concentration is apparently larger than the films deposited at higher fH2 and the change of OB is strongly correlated with VO. Consequently, it could be concluded that less VO is the main reason for the sharp decrease of carrier concentration in high fH2 preparing films, VO release two free electrons while H+ releases only one free electron. Furthermore, the carrier concentration reduced to 1.81 × 1020 cm−3 at H- Fgas. The fH2 obviously has an effect on the mobility of IMO:H films. The carrier mobility of IMO:H films firstly increases from 58.29 cm2V−1s−1 to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.1 % under L- Fgas. However, the mobility is down to ~34 cm2V−1s−1 when the film fabricated at fH2 of 0.2 %, whether under L- Fgas or H- Fgas. The change of mobility is relevant to scattering mechanisms, such as ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering [11]. The increasing mobility of IMO:H films is mainly related to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers served by oxygen vacancies, which could be confirmed from XPS results. However, the decline in mobility of the film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 may be attributed to defected grain boundaries, caused by the diffusion of H and OH intragrain species to the grain boundary and the formation of indium hydroxides at the grain boundary during annealing treatment [26]. Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, the IMO:H films with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas shows lowest resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm, while the film with 0.2 % fH2 deposited at H- Fgas shows highest resistivity of 1.02 × 10−3 Ω cm. 3.4. Optical properties In order to exclude the influence of reflection, the effective total transmittance (TTe) spectra are used to evaluate the absorption properties of IMO:H films. TTe is defined as [23]: TTe = T 1 −R (1) where T is the transmittance and R is the reflectance. Fig. 4 (a) displays the TTe and reflectance of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. It is clearly observed that increasing fH2 and Fgas enhances the transmittance of IMO:H films in the region from 600 nm to 1200 nm. The average TTe above 600 nm increases from 97.86 % to 98.86 % with an increasing fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % and the average TTe further increase to 99.11 % when deposited at H- Fgas. The variation of transmittance in the infrared wavelength region has strong correlation with free carrier absorption (FCA) [35]. The increase of fH2 and Fgas will reduce the carrier concentration, leading to the weakening of FCA effect, which is favorable to the transmittance of IMO:H films. The variation of reflectance is the same as the variation of TTe. Besides, Fig. 4 (b) presents the optical constants refractive index and extinction coefficient of IMO:H films. The refractive index of IMO:H films slightly increases by the increment of fH2 under L- Fgas. It is found that the refractive index increases with decreasing carrier concentration, which is consistent with previous reports in TCO films [36]. The film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas has the highest refractive index and lowest extinction coefficient. 3.5. SHJ performance According to the above research of structural, optical, and electrical properties of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas, we applied the film on SHJ solar cell’s front (n) and rear (p) side respectively and the other side deposited with ITO films, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows key parameters of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the front side. As expected, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of solar cells have been improved with hydrogenated films on the front side from 38.66 mA/cm2 to 39.14 mA/cm2. The enhancement of JSC of SHJ solar cells is ascribing to higher transmittance of hydrogenated films, and the highest JSC cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas have the highest TTe curve in Fig. 4 (a). Fig. 7 (a) displays the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these cells with non-hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and hydrogenated films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as front side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows an improvement above the wavelength of 500 nm, consistent with the result of improved JSC as shown in Fig. 6 (b). Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells with the addition of hydrogen at the stage of TCO preparation in Fig. 6 (a) is lower than the samples without hydrogen, considering that hydrogen radicals or ions generated in the plasma could etch the underlying layer at the beginning of TCO deposition, the effusion of hydrogen from underlying layer and generation of dangling bonds at a-Si:H(i)/Cz-Si interface could trigger the deterioration of the passivation quality [37]. It is well known that fill factor (FF) has strong relationship with series resistance (RS), the RS curve is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Since the increasing carrier concentration of TCO films leads to a reduction contact resistivity at the ITO/a-Si:H(n) interface as reported by C. Luderer [38], the deterioration of fill factor (FF) for SHJ solar cells with front hydrogenated films could be ascribed to the superposition of high contact resistances of IMO:H film/nc-Si(n) Fig. 3. Carrier concentration, mobility, and resistivity of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 5 contact and the resistivity of the IMO:H film itself. Finally, the average PCE up to 21.14 % is obtained with front IMO:H film solar cells when the film is deposited at 0 % fH2 under L- Fgas. Fig. 8 shows the performance of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the rear side. The JSC is the lowest of 38.79 mA/cm2 when the film fabricated without hydrogen under L- Fgas, while the highest JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 is obtained when the cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. Fig. 9 (a) displays the EQE of these cells with non- hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and IMO:H films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as rear side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows better spectral response in the wavelength from 1000 to 1200 nm. Since the solar spectrum reaching the rear side of SHJ cells are mainly composed of infrared light, the higher refractive index and reflectivity of IMO:H films under H- Fgas in the NIR region could Fig. 4. Optical (a) effective total transmittance and reflectance, (b) refractive index and extinction coefficient curves of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas.

Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 6 improve the scattering of light and support stronger spectral response, thereby enhancing the JSC [39]. FF first increases and then decreases with higher fH2 under L- Fgas and further decreases under H- Fgas, and the series resistance of solar cells shown in Fig. 9 (b) is consistent with the parabolic change of IMO:H films’ resistivity in Fig. 3. A low resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm is obtained with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas, leading to the highest FF of 82.18 %. It is well known that sputter damage has an impact on the performance of SHJ solar cells [40]. To investigate the impact of IMO:H sputtering on VOC, Fig. 10 shows the effective carrier lifetime (τeff) at the Fig. 7. (a) EQE curve of SHJ solar cells.

In our experiment, the thickness of n-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (n)) is about 20 nm, while the thickness of p-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (p)) is approximately 30 nm. The thickness of nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer has a certain effect on alleviating sputtering damage thinner nc-Si:H layer suffer severe sputtering damage. Vividly, the curing process recovers the sputter-induced degradation passivation for cells with IMO:H on rear side, while the passivation for cells with IMO:H on front side did not reach the initial state, leading to a generally lower VOC when IMO:H applied on the front side. In addition, unlike the performance of IMO:H used as front side, the flat variation in VOC shows that hydrogen treatment during the formation of rear side IMO:H does not erode passivation effect, which may attribute to 10 nm thicker nc-Si:H (p) layer conductive to moderate the destruction of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the degradation after hydrogen treatment sputtering is recovered after 200 ◦C curing. Finally, the champion solar cell with VOC of 744.45 mV, ISC of 38.93 A, FF of 82.18 % and PCE up to 23.81 % is obtained with rear IMO:H film deposited at 0.1 % fH2 under L- Fgas. 4. Conclusion In this study, high performance IMO:H films are fabricated by DC sputtering technique at room temperature, followed by 200 ◦C post- annealing. The structural, electrical and optical properties of IMO:H films has been investigated as a function of gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and total gas flow rate (Fgas). The experimental results indicate that all films feature preferential orientation (400) and lattice distortion is further aggravated under higher total gas flow rate. The addition of hydrogen in sputtering gases can enhance carrier mobility, and the film prepared with fH2 of 0.1 % at low total gas flow rate shows high mobility of 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with lowest resistivity of approximately 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm and relatively high transmittance in the wavelength range above 500 nm. When employing IMO:H films as transparent electrode in SHJ solar cells, the devices with hydrogenated films have higher JSC and the highest average JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 are obtained finally, ascribing to excellent optical performance. Besides, when IMO:H films are applied as the rear side of SHJ devices, the solar cells were achieved the maximum PCE of 23.81 %, and the average PCE is 0.18%abs improvement compared to non-hydrogen film. The findings prove that hydrogen doped In2O3 based films provide the possibility of application in SHJ solar cells or other optoelectronic devices which require high transmittance and high mobility TCO films.

Herein, hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Ga-doped indium oxide (IMO:H) films are explored and the structural and optical-electrical characteristics were optimized with the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen and total gas flow rate. IMO:H films exhibit preferential orientation growth in <100> direction and a distinct shift to higher 2θ with the addition hydrogen is observed due to the size mismatch between doped ions and In ions. Furthermore, the carrier concentration of IMO:H films is decreased due to the substitution of oxygen vacancies by hydrogen, leading to the decrement of free carrier absorption and a 1.25%abs increase of effective total transmittance is obtained in the region from 600 to 1200 nm.

Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have attracted considerable interest among high-efficiency photovoltaic devices due to their high open-circuit voltage (VOC), low temperature process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) [1]. A word record PCE of 26.8 % for SHJ solar cells on M6 wafers with VOC up to 751.4 mV was achieved by LONGi in 2022 [2]. However, there is still a gap existed with respect to short-circuit current density (JSC) when compared to tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) solar cells. The parasitic absorption of window layers such as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in SHJ solar cells hinders the improvement of JSC and the use of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) rather than a-Si:H could potentially provide an additional gain in JSC [3]. Besides, as the first window layer of SHJ solar cells, it is essential to explore and develop TCO films with better optical and electrical properties. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been commonly used in SHJ solar cells [4], while their optical performance has been restricted in the * Corresponding author.

Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, a feasible approach to achieve the best balance between electrical and optical properties of TCO films is to enhance carrier mobility and to reduce free carrier concentration at the same time. Numerous efforts have been used to obtain high mobility TCO films and metallic cations used as dopants in In2O3 films is demonstrated to be an effective way [6–8]. Several studies investigated that high Lewis acid dopants could suppress scattering centers hence enhancing the mobility [9,10]. Transition metal dopants (W6+, Mo6+, Zr4+, Ti4+) possess higher Lewis acid strengths than Sn4+ ions in In2O3-based films and presents high carrier mobility exceeding 80 cm2V−1s−1 [11–15]. Ga dopants in In2O3 lattice cannot be ionized impurity scattering centers and are known to be carrier suppressor [16]. However, most of these high performance films require high-temperature preparation or post thermal treatment, which is not compatible with the production of SHJ solar cells. Recently, much attention has been paid to co-doping and multiple-doping processes in which two or more metallic cations are doped into In2O3 films simultaneously to realize high mobility TCO films at lower temperature [17–20]. In addition, it is reported that hydrogen impurities in In2O3 play the role of shallow donors whether interstitial hydrogen or substitutional hydrogen [21], and some reports suggest that hydrogen introduced into process gases could be an effective way for In2O3-based thin films to alter electrical properties [18,22,23]. Up to now, only few investigations are available for hydrogenated multiple doped In2O3 films and their application in SHJ solar cells. Direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method is one of the most used deposition technique to obtain high-quality TCO films [24]. The optical-electrical properties of the films are sensitive to the sputtering parameters, such as sputtering power and deposition temperature [25, 26]. It is worth mention that variation of total gas flow rate under the same pressure is an effective way to moderate pumping speed, which may in turn imposes alteration on process gases concentration in chamber and consequently affects the properties of TCO [27,28]. However, the effects of total gas flow rate on the performance of multiple doped In2O3 films has not been fully explored. In this work, ~100-nm-thick hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 (IMO:H) films were deposited with various gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and different total gas flow rate (Fgas) via DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature followed by 200 ◦C air annealing, and detailed information about this material could be found in our previous study [29]. The structural, electrical and optical properties of the IMO:H films were systematically investigated. It was found that high performance W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 films could be obtained by optimizing fH2 and Fgas, and we applied these films as front TCO or rear TCO in SHJ solar cells. Finally, we demonstrate that higher PCE of SHJ solar cells can be come through with the implementation of IMO:H films as rear transparent electrode. 2. Experiment In the experiment, the IMO:H films were prepared onto glass substrates (Corning 7059) by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The background pressure was pumped to 9 × 10−4 Pa before process gases entered the chamber. The sputtering power was 120 W with power density of 0.66 W/cm2. The introduced gases were argon (Ar), oxygen (O2) and the mixture of hydrogen and argon (Ar + H2, H2 was 0.5 % diluted in Ar). The gas flow rate ratio of oxygen fO2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was kept constant at 2 % and the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 = [Ar + H2] × 0.5 %/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was varied from 0 % to 0.2 %, where the [Ar], [O2] and [Ar + H2] were the gas flow rate of Ar, O2 and mixture of Ar and H2. The total gas flow rate Fgas = [O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2] was under 50 sccm (L- Fgas). Besides, the film preparation at 0.2 % fH2 was also deposited under Fgas of 100 sccm (H- Fgas). The chamber pressure was manually kept at 0.45 Pa during the process and we opened the valve to increase effective pumping speed to maintain the pressure at high total gas flow rates. The ceramic target in this study was made of indium oxide doped by 0.3 wt% WO3, 0.5 wt% MoO3, 0.6 wt% TiO2, 1.0 wt% ZrO2, and 0.6 wt% Ga2O3 with a purity of 99.99 %, provided by Luoyang Jinglian Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. The thickness of the IMO:H films was about 100 nm and all samples were annealed at 200 ◦C in air atmosphere for 30 min. To investigate the influence of IMO:H films on device performance under various process conditions, the corresponding single-sided rear- emitter IMO:H film SHJ solar cells were fabricated on 156 mm × 156 mm n-type Czochralski c-Si wafers (thickness, 150 μm; resistivity, 1–5 Ω). Firstly, these wafers were etched in potassium hydroxide (KOH) to obtain pyramid surface texture, followed by the standard RCA processes. Then the wafers were dipped in 3–5 % hydrofluoric acid for 1 min. Later, these wafers were transferred to PECVD chambers to deposit intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer and doped nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H(n/p)) contact layer to form a structure of nc-Si:H (n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-Si:H(p). Subsequently, all wafers were divided into two groups, front-side groups had IMO:H films on the front side and ITO films on the rear side, the other group is rear-side groups with ITO films on the front side and IMO:H films on the rear side. The thickness of ITO films was the same as IMO:H films, and the IMO:H films were deposited under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. Finally, silver electrodes were screen-printed on both sides, followed by 30-min annealing at 200 ◦C. The thickness and optical constant of IMO:H films were extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE, J.A Woollan Co., Inc. M _ 2000) with Tauc-Lorentz and Drude model. The crystalline structure information was obtained via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200/PC) with Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15405 nm) and θ-2θ scan mode, with the diffraction angle ranging from 20 to 70◦. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI–5000C) was used to analysis the chemical state of the elements within IMO:H films. The electrical properties were monitored by Hall-effect measurement at room temperature by Ecopia HMS-5300 system. A Uv–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) was utilized to acquire optical transmission and reflection spectra at a wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm. All the films were characterized with glass substrate. The I–V characteristic of SHJ cells were measured using a solar simulator (100 mW/cm2) under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25 ◦C). Sinton WCT-120, with quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurement, was used to measure effective carrier lifetime (τeff). 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Crystallite structure The XRD patterns of IMO:H films under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the films well match with the typical cubic In2O3 powder data (JCPDS No.06-0416), indicating that low doping content of cation dopants does not cause additional phase. The intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) is larger than the standard values of In2O3 powder data (0.3) as shown in Fig. 1(b), manifesting a preferential orientation growth in the <100> direction. Fig. 1(c) depicts that the peak position of (400) diffraction peak is slightly shifted to larger angle with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 %, indicating a contraction in the lattice constant owing to the occupation of hydrogen into oxygen sites in the In2O3 lattice [21]. However, the shift further to higher 2θ of the film deposited under H- Fgas may come from the reason that the intense gas flow direct to the substrate and heavy incorporation of smaller cation (W, Mo, Ti, Ga) into the In sites of the In2O3 lattice lead to lattice distortion caused by macroscopic residual stresses [30,31]. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 3 3.2. Chemical state analysis In order to probe the change of oxygen vacancy content and hydroxide species in IMO:H films, Fig. 2 illustrates the O1s core level peaks of XPS spectra for IMO:H films with different fH2 and different Fgas. The O1s peak can be fitted into three Gauss-Lorentz peaks with binding energy values of 529.6eV, 530.3eV and 531.8eV, respectively. Peak OA observed at the lowest binding energy at 529.6eV is related to the lattice oxygen attached to the metallic elements in the cubic In2O3 structure, while the peak at 530.3eV (OB) is ascribed to oxygen deficiency sites [32]. The area of OB is relevant to the concentration of free carriers generating by oxygen vacancies. The highest binding energy at 531.8eV (OC) corresponds to metal hydroxide peak [33]. The O1s core level peaks are fitted to investigated the relationship between the chemical states of Fig. 1. (a) XRD pattern of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. (b) Intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) of IMO:H films. (c) Enlarged (400) peak. Fig. 2.

(e) The estimated area ration of peak OB (calculated as OB/(OA + OB + OC)) and peak OC (calculated as OC/(OA + OB + OC)). S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 4 oxygen and different fH2 under different Fgas. The relative area ratios of peak OB and peak OC to all the three peaks, OB/(OA + OB + OC) and OC/(OA + OB + OC), are extracted from the fitted curves, where OA, OB, OC represents the area of peak OA, OB and OC, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e). A significant decrease of OB ratio with increasing the fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas is observed, accompanied by continuously increment of OC ratio, illustrating that the incorporation of H+ ions promote to bind to oxygen vacancies to be a donor or to form a number of hydroxyl groups due to the stabilization of hydrogen [34]. It is worth mentioning that the enhancement of Fgas at fH2 of 0.2 % leads to smaller OB and lager OC, meaning less oxygen vacancies and more hydroxyl formed at H- Fgas. 3.3. Electrical properties The electrical properties of the IMO:H films are analyzed by Hall- effect measurements. Fig. 3 shows the carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity of the films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. As observed in Fig. 3(a), the carrier concentration of the films decreases from 4.06 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.87 × 1020 cm−3 when fH2 increases from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas. The free carriers of the IMO:H films are mainly generated from oxygen vacancies (VO), hydrogen donors and metal substitution of In3+ by W6+, Mo6+, Ti4+, and Zr4+. From the XPS results (Fig. 2(e)), the OB ratio of the film without hydrogen having higher carrier concentration is apparently larger than the films deposited at higher fH2 and the change of OB is strongly correlated with VO. Consequently, it could be concluded that less VO is the main reason for the sharp decrease of carrier concentration in high fH2 preparing films, VO release two free electrons while H+ releases only one free electron. Furthermore, the carrier concentration reduced to 1.81 × 1020 cm−3 at H- Fgas. The fH2 obviously has an effect on the mobility of IMO:H films. The carrier mobility of IMO:H films firstly increases from 58.29 cm2V−1s−1 to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.1 % under L- Fgas. However, the mobility is down to ~34 cm2V−1s−1 when the film fabricated at fH2 of 0.2 %, whether under L- Fgas or H- Fgas. The change of mobility is relevant to scattering mechanisms, such as ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering [11]. The increasing mobility of IMO:H films is mainly related to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers served by oxygen vacancies, which could be confirmed from XPS results. However, the decline in mobility of the film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 may be attributed to defected grain boundaries, caused by the diffusion of H and OH intragrain species to the grain boundary and the formation of indium hydroxides at the grain boundary during annealing treatment [26]. Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, the IMO:H films with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas shows lowest resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm, while the film with 0.2 % fH2 deposited at H- Fgas shows highest resistivity of 1.02 × 10−3 Ω cm. 3.4. Optical properties In order to exclude the influence of reflection, the effective total transmittance (TTe) spectra are used to evaluate the absorption properties of IMO:H films. TTe is defined as [23]: TTe = T 1 −R (1) where T is the transmittance and R is the reflectance. Fig. 4 (a) displays the TTe and reflectance of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. It is clearly observed that increasing fH2 and Fgas enhances the transmittance of IMO:H films in the region from 600 nm to 1200 nm. The average TTe above 600 nm increases from 97.86 % to 98.86 % with an increasing fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % and the average TTe further increase to 99.11 % when deposited at H- Fgas. The variation of transmittance in the infrared wavelength region has strong correlation with free carrier absorption (FCA) [35]. The increase of fH2 and Fgas will reduce the carrier concentration, leading to the weakening of FCA effect, which is favorable to the transmittance of IMO:H films. The variation of reflectance is the same as the variation of TTe. Besides, Fig. 4 (b) presents the optical constants refractive index and extinction coefficient of IMO:H films. The refractive index of IMO:H films slightly increases by the increment of fH2 under L- Fgas. It is found that the refractive index increases with decreasing carrier concentration, which is consistent with previous reports in TCO films [36]. The film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas has the highest refractive index and lowest extinction coefficient. 3.5. SHJ performance According to the above research of structural, optical, and electrical properties of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas, we applied the film on SHJ solar cell’s front (n) and rear (p) side respectively and the other side deposited with ITO films, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows key parameters of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the front side. As expected, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of solar cells have been improved with hydrogenated films on the front side from 38.66 mA/cm2 to 39.14 mA/cm2. The enhancement of JSC of SHJ solar cells is ascribing to higher transmittance of hydrogenated films, and the highest JSC cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas have the highest TTe curve in Fig. 4 (a). Fig. 7 (a) displays the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these cells with non-hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and hydrogenated films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as front side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows an improvement above the wavelength of 500 nm, consistent with the result of improved JSC as shown in Fig. 6 (b). Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells with the addition of hydrogen at the stage of TCO preparation in Fig. 6 (a) is lower than the samples without hydrogen, considering that hydrogen radicals or ions generated in the plasma could etch the underlying layer at the beginning of TCO deposition, the effusion of hydrogen from underlying layer and generation of dangling bonds at a-Si:H(i)/Cz-Si interface could trigger the deterioration of the passivation quality [37]. It is well known that fill factor (FF) has strong relationship with series resistance (RS), the RS curve is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Since the increasing carrier concentration of TCO films leads to a reduction contact resistivity at the ITO/a-Si:H(n) interface as reported by C. Luderer [38], the deterioration of fill factor (FF) for SHJ solar cells with front hydrogenated films could be ascribed to the superposition of high contact resistances of IMO:H film/nc-Si(n) Fig. 3. Carrier concentration, mobility, and resistivity of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 5 contact and the resistivity of the IMO:H film itself. Finally, the average PCE up to 21.14 % is obtained with front IMO:H film solar cells when the film is deposited at 0 % fH2 under L- Fgas. Fig. 8 shows the performance of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the rear side. The JSC is the lowest of 38.79 mA/cm2 when the film fabricated without hydrogen under L- Fgas, while the highest JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 is obtained when the cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. Fig. 9 (a) displays the EQE of these cells with non- hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and IMO:H films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as rear side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows better spectral response in the wavelength from 1000 to 1200 nm. Since the solar spectrum reaching the rear side of SHJ cells are mainly composed of infrared light, the higher refractive index and reflectivity of IMO:H films under H- Fgas in the NIR region could Fig. 4. Optical (a) effective total transmittance and reflectance, (b) refractive index and extinction coefficient curves of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas.

Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 6 improve the scattering of light and support stronger spectral response, thereby enhancing the JSC [39]. FF first increases and then decreases with higher fH2 under L- Fgas and further decreases under H- Fgas, and the series resistance of solar cells shown in Fig. 9 (b) is consistent with the parabolic change of IMO:H films’ resistivity in Fig. 3. A low resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm is obtained with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas, leading to the highest FF of 82.18 %. It is well known that sputter damage has an impact on the performance of SHJ solar cells [40]. To investigate the impact of IMO:H sputtering on VOC, Fig. 10 shows the effective carrier lifetime (τeff) at the Fig. 7. (a) EQE curve of SHJ solar cells.

In our experiment, the thickness of n-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (n)) is about 20 nm, while the thickness of p-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (p)) is approximately 30 nm. The thickness of nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer has a certain effect on alleviating sputtering damage thinner nc-Si:H layer suffer severe sputtering damage. Vividly, the curing process recovers the sputter-induced degradation passivation for cells with IMO:H on rear side, while the passivation for cells with IMO:H on front side did not reach the initial state, leading to a generally lower VOC when IMO:H applied on the front side. In addition, unlike the performance of IMO:H used as front side, the flat variation in VOC shows that hydrogen treatment during the formation of rear side IMO:H does not erode passivation effect, which may attribute to 10 nm thicker nc-Si:H (p) layer conductive to moderate the destruction of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the degradation after hydrogen treatment sputtering is recovered after 200 ◦C curing. Finally, the champion solar cell with VOC of 744.45 mV, ISC of 38.93 A, FF of 82.18 % and PCE up to 23.81 % is obtained with rear IMO:H film deposited at 0.1 % fH2 under L- Fgas. 4. Conclusion In this study, high performance IMO:H films are fabricated by DC sputtering technique at room temperature, followed by 200 ◦C post- annealing. The structural, electrical and optical properties of IMO:H films has been investigated as a function of gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and total gas flow rate (Fgas). The experimental results indicate that all films feature preferential orientation (400) and lattice distortion is further aggravated under higher total gas flow rate. The addition of hydrogen in sputtering gases can enhance carrier mobility, and the film prepared with fH2 of 0.1 % at low total gas flow rate shows high mobility of 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with lowest resistivity of approximately 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm and relatively high transmittance in the wavelength range above 500 nm. When employing IMO:H films as transparent electrode in SHJ solar cells, the devices with hydrogenated films have higher JSC and the highest average JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 are obtained finally, ascribing to excellent optical performance. Besides, when IMO:H films are applied as the rear side of SHJ devices, the solar cells were achieved the maximum PCE of 23.81 %, and the average PCE is 0.18%abs improvement compared to non-hydrogen film. The findings prove that hydrogen doped In2O3 based films provide the possibility of application in SHJ solar cells or other optoelectronic devices which require high transmittance and high mobility TCO films.

Herein, hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Ga-doped indium oxide (IMO:H) films are explored and the structural and optical-electrical characteristics were optimized with the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen and total gas flow rate. IMO:H films exhibit preferential orientation growth in <100> direction and a distinct shift to higher 2θ with the addition hydrogen is observed due to the size mismatch between doped ions and In ions.

Introduction In recent years, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells have attracted considerable interest among high-efficiency photovoltaic devices due to their high open-circuit voltage (VOC), low temperature process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) [1]. A word record PCE of 26.8 % for SHJ solar cells on M6 wafers with VOC up to 751.4 mV was achieved by LONGi in 2022 [2]. However, there is still a gap existed with respect to short-circuit current density (JSC) when compared to tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) solar cells. The parasitic absorption of window layers such as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in SHJ solar cells hinders the improvement of JSC and the use of hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) rather than a-Si:H could potentially provide an additional gain in JSC [3]. Besides, as the first window layer of SHJ solar cells, it is essential to explore and develop TCO films with better optical and electrical properties. Indium tin oxide (ITO) films have been commonly used in SHJ solar cells [4], while their optical performance has been restricted in the * Corresponding author.

Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, a feasible approach to achieve the best balance between electrical and optical properties of TCO films is to enhance carrier mobility and to reduce free carrier concentration at the same time. Numerous efforts have been used to obtain high mobility TCO films and metallic cations used as dopants in In2O3 films is demonstrated to be an effective way [6–8]. Several studies investigated that high Lewis acid dopants could suppress scattering centers hence enhancing the mobility [9,10]. Transition metal dopants (W6+, Mo6+, Zr4+, Ti4+) possess higher Lewis acid strengths than Sn4+ ions in In2O3-based films and presents high carrier mobility exceeding 80 cm2V−1s−1 [11–15]. Ga dopants in In2O3 lattice cannot be ionized impurity scattering centers and are known to be carrier suppressor [16]. However, most of these high performance films require high-temperature preparation or post thermal treatment, which is not compatible with the production of SHJ solar cells. Recently, much attention has been paid to co-doping and multiple-doping processes in which two or more metallic cations are doped into In2O3 films simultaneously to realize high mobility TCO films at lower temperature [17–20]. In addition, it is reported that hydrogen impurities in In2O3 play the role of shallow donors whether interstitial hydrogen or substitutional hydrogen [21], and some reports suggest that hydrogen introduced into process gases could be an effective way for In2O3-based thin films to alter electrical properties [18,22,23]. Up to now, only few investigations are available for hydrogenated multiple doped In2O3 films and their application in SHJ solar cells. Direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method is one of the most used deposition technique to obtain high-quality TCO films [24]. The optical-electrical properties of the films are sensitive to the sputtering parameters, such as sputtering power and deposition temperature [25, 26]. It is worth mention that variation of total gas flow rate under the same pressure is an effective way to moderate pumping speed, which may in turn imposes alteration on process gases concentration in chamber and consequently affects the properties of TCO [27,28]. However, the effects of total gas flow rate on the performance of multiple doped In2O3 films has not been fully explored. In this work, ~100-nm-thick hydrogenated W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 (IMO:H) films were deposited with various gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and different total gas flow rate (Fgas) via DC magnetron sputtering method at room temperature followed by 200 ◦C air annealing, and detailed information about this material could be found in our previous study [29]. The structural, electrical and optical properties of the IMO:H films were systematically investigated. It was found that high performance W, Mo, Ti, Zr and Ga doped In2O3 films could be obtained by optimizing fH2 and Fgas, and we applied these films as front TCO or rear TCO in SHJ solar cells. Finally, we demonstrate that higher PCE of SHJ solar cells can be come through with the implementation of IMO:H films as rear transparent electrode. 2. Experiment In the experiment, the IMO:H films were prepared onto glass substrates (Corning 7059) by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The background pressure was pumped to 9 × 10−4 Pa before process gases entered the chamber. The sputtering power was 120 W with power density of 0.66 W/cm2. The introduced gases were argon (Ar), oxygen (O2) and the mixture of hydrogen and argon (Ar + H2, H2 was 0.5 % diluted in Ar). The gas flow rate ratio of oxygen fO2 = [O2]/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was kept constant at 2 % and the gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 = [Ar + H2] × 0.5 %/([O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2]) was varied from 0 % to 0.2 %, where the [Ar], [O2] and [Ar + H2] were the gas flow rate of Ar, O2 and mixture of Ar and H2. The total gas flow rate Fgas = [O2] + [Ar] + [Ar + H2] was under 50 sccm (L- Fgas). Besides, the film preparation at 0.2 % fH2 was also deposited under Fgas of 100 sccm (H- Fgas). The chamber pressure was manually kept at 0.45 Pa during the process and we opened the valve to increase effective pumping speed to maintain the pressure at high total gas flow rates. The ceramic target in this study was made of indium oxide doped by 0.3 wt% WO3, 0.5 wt% MoO3, 0.6 wt% TiO2, 1.0 wt% ZrO2, and 0.6 wt% Ga2O3 with a purity of 99.99 %, provided by Luoyang Jinglian Photoelectric Materials Co., Ltd. The thickness of the IMO:H films was about 100 nm and all samples were annealed at 200 ◦C in air atmosphere for 30 min. To investigate the influence of IMO:H films on device performance under various process conditions, the corresponding single-sided rear- emitter IMO:H film SHJ solar cells were fabricated on 156 mm × 156 mm n-type Czochralski c-Si wafers (thickness, 150 μm; resistivity, 1–5 Ω). Firstly, these wafers were etched in potassium hydroxide (KOH) to obtain pyramid surface texture, followed by the standard RCA processes. Then the wafers were dipped in 3–5 % hydrofluoric acid for 1 min. Later, these wafers were transferred to PECVD chambers to deposit intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) passivation layer and doped nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H(n/p)) contact layer to form a structure of nc-Si:H (n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si/a-Si:H(i)/nc-Si:H(p). Subsequently, all wafers were divided into two groups, front-side groups had IMO:H films on the front side and ITO films on the rear side, the other group is rear-side groups with ITO films on the front side and IMO:H films on the rear side. The thickness of ITO films was the same as IMO:H films, and the IMO:H films were deposited under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. Finally, silver electrodes were screen-printed on both sides, followed by 30-min annealing at 200 ◦C. The thickness and optical constant of IMO:H films were extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE, J.A Woollan Co., Inc. M _ 2000) with Tauc-Lorentz and Drude model. The crystalline structure information was obtained via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200/PC) with Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15405 nm) and θ-2θ scan mode, with the diffraction angle ranging from 20 to 70◦. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI–5000C) was used to analysis the chemical state of the elements within IMO:H films. The electrical properties were monitored by Hall-effect measurement at room temperature by Ecopia HMS-5300 system. A Uv–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950) was utilized to acquire optical transmission and reflection spectra at a wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm. All the films were characterized with glass substrate. The I–V characteristic of SHJ cells were measured using a solar simulator (100 mW/cm2) under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 25 ◦C). Sinton WCT-120, with quasi-steady-state photoconductance measurement, was used to measure effective carrier lifetime (τeff). 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Crystallite structure The XRD patterns of IMO:H films under different gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the films well match with the typical cubic In2O3 powder data (JCPDS No.06-0416), indicating that low doping content of cation dopants does not cause additional phase. The intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) is larger than the standard values of In2O3 powder data (0.3) as shown in Fig. 1(b), manifesting a preferential orientation growth in the <100> direction. Fig. 1(c) depicts that the peak position of (400) diffraction peak is slightly shifted to larger angle with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 %, indicating a contraction in the lattice constant owing to the occupation of hydrogen into oxygen sites in the In2O3 lattice [21]. However, the shift further to higher 2θ of the film deposited under H- Fgas may come from the reason that the intense gas flow direct to the substrate and heavy incorporation of smaller cation (W, Mo, Ti, Ga) into the In sites of the In2O3 lattice lead to lattice distortion caused by macroscopic residual stresses [30,31]. S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 3 3.2. Chemical state analysis In order to probe the change of oxygen vacancy content and hydroxide species in IMO:H films, Fig. 2 illustrates the O1s core level peaks of XPS spectra for IMO:H films with different fH2 and different Fgas. The O1s peak can be fitted into three Gauss-Lorentz peaks with binding energy values of 529.6eV, 530.3eV and 531.8eV, respectively. Peak OA observed at the lowest binding energy at 529.6eV is related to the lattice oxygen attached to the metallic elements in the cubic In2O3 structure, while the peak at 530.3eV (OB) is ascribed to oxygen deficiency sites [32]. The area of OB is relevant to the concentration of free carriers generating by oxygen vacancies. The highest binding energy at 531.8eV (OC) corresponds to metal hydroxide peak [33]. The O1s core level peaks are fitted to investigated the relationship between the chemical states of Fig. 1. (a) XRD pattern of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. (b) Intensity ratio of I(400)/I(222) of IMO:H films. (c) Enlarged (400) peak. Fig. 2.

(e) The estimated area ration of peak OB (calculated as OB/(OA + OB + OC)) and peak OC (calculated as OC/(OA + OB + OC)). S. Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 4 oxygen and different fH2 under different Fgas. The relative area ratios of peak OB and peak OC to all the three peaks, OB/(OA + OB + OC) and OC/(OA + OB + OC), are extracted from the fitted curves, where OA, OB, OC represents the area of peak OA, OB and OC, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e). A significant decrease of OB ratio with increasing the fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas is observed, accompanied by continuously increment of OC ratio, illustrating that the incorporation of H+ ions promote to bind to oxygen vacancies to be a donor or to form a number of hydroxyl groups due to the stabilization of hydrogen [34]. It is worth mentioning that the enhancement of Fgas at fH2 of 0.2 % leads to smaller OB and lager OC, meaning less oxygen vacancies and more hydroxyl formed at H- Fgas. 3.3. Electrical properties The electrical properties of the IMO:H films are analyzed by Hall- effect measurements. Fig. 3 shows the carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity of the films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. As observed in Fig. 3(a), the carrier concentration of the films decreases from 4.06 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.87 × 1020 cm−3 when fH2 increases from 0 % to 0.2 % at L- Fgas. The free carriers of the IMO:H films are mainly generated from oxygen vacancies (VO), hydrogen donors and metal substitution of In3+ by W6+, Mo6+, Ti4+, and Zr4+. From the XPS results (Fig. 2(e)), the OB ratio of the film without hydrogen having higher carrier concentration is apparently larger than the films deposited at higher fH2 and the change of OB is strongly correlated with VO. Consequently, it could be concluded that less VO is the main reason for the sharp decrease of carrier concentration in high fH2 preparing films, VO release two free electrons while H+ releases only one free electron. Furthermore, the carrier concentration reduced to 1.81 × 1020 cm−3 at H- Fgas. The fH2 obviously has an effect on the mobility of IMO:H films. The carrier mobility of IMO:H films firstly increases from 58.29 cm2V−1s−1 to 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with the increment of fH2 from 0 % to 0.1 % under L- Fgas. However, the mobility is down to ~34 cm2V−1s−1 when the film fabricated at fH2 of 0.2 %, whether under L- Fgas or H- Fgas. The change of mobility is relevant to scattering mechanisms, such as ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering [11]. The increasing mobility of IMO:H films is mainly related to the reduction of ionized impurity scattering centers served by oxygen vacancies, which could be confirmed from XPS results. However, the decline in mobility of the film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 may be attributed to defected grain boundaries, caused by the diffusion of H and OH intragrain species to the grain boundary and the formation of indium hydroxides at the grain boundary during annealing treatment [26]. Since resistivity depends on the reciprocal of the product of mobility and carrier concentration, the IMO:H films with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas shows lowest resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm, while the film with 0.2 % fH2 deposited at H- Fgas shows highest resistivity of 1.02 × 10−3 Ω cm. 3.4. Optical properties In order to exclude the influence of reflection, the effective total transmittance (TTe) spectra are used to evaluate the absorption properties of IMO:H films. TTe is defined as [23]: TTe = T 1 −R (1) where T is the transmittance and R is the reflectance. Fig. 4 (a) displays the TTe and reflectance of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. It is clearly observed that increasing fH2 and Fgas enhances the transmittance of IMO:H films in the region from 600 nm to 1200 nm. The average TTe above 600 nm increases from 97.86 % to 98.86 % with an increasing fH2 from 0 % to 0.2 % and the average TTe further increase to 99.11 % when deposited at H- Fgas. The variation of transmittance in the infrared wavelength region has strong correlation with free carrier absorption (FCA) [35]. The increase of fH2 and Fgas will reduce the carrier concentration, leading to the weakening of FCA effect, which is favorable to the transmittance of IMO:H films. The variation of reflectance is the same as the variation of TTe. Besides, Fig. 4 (b) presents the optical constants refractive index and extinction coefficient of IMO:H films. The refractive index of IMO:H films slightly increases by the increment of fH2 under L- Fgas. It is found that the refractive index increases with decreasing carrier concentration, which is consistent with previous reports in TCO films [36]. The film deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas has the highest refractive index and lowest extinction coefficient. 3.5. SHJ performance According to the above research of structural, optical, and electrical properties of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas, we applied the film on SHJ solar cell’s front (n) and rear (p) side respectively and the other side deposited with ITO films, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows key parameters of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the front side. As expected, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of solar cells have been improved with hydrogenated films on the front side from 38.66 mA/cm2 to 39.14 mA/cm2. The enhancement of JSC of SHJ solar cells is ascribing to higher transmittance of hydrogenated films, and the highest JSC cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas have the highest TTe curve in Fig. 4 (a). Fig. 7 (a) displays the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these cells with non-hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and hydrogenated films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as front side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows an improvement above the wavelength of 500 nm, consistent with the result of improved JSC as shown in Fig. 6 (b). Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells with the addition of hydrogen at the stage of TCO preparation in Fig. 6 (a) is lower than the samples without hydrogen, considering that hydrogen radicals or ions generated in the plasma could etch the underlying layer at the beginning of TCO deposition, the effusion of hydrogen from underlying layer and generation of dangling bonds at a-Si:H(i)/Cz-Si interface could trigger the deterioration of the passivation quality [37]. It is well known that fill factor (FF) has strong relationship with series resistance (RS), the RS curve is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Since the increasing carrier concentration of TCO films leads to a reduction contact resistivity at the ITO/a-Si:H(n) interface as reported by C. Luderer [38], the deterioration of fill factor (FF) for SHJ solar cells with front hydrogenated films could be ascribed to the superposition of high contact resistances of IMO:H film/nc-Si(n) Fig. 3. Carrier concentration, mobility, and resistivity of IMO:H films with fH2 varied from 0 % to 0.2 % under L- Fgas and fH2 at 0.2 % under H- Fgas. S. Chen et al.

Finally, the average PCE up to 21.14 % is obtained with front IMO:H film solar cells when the film is deposited at 0 % fH2 under L- Fgas. Fig. 8 shows the performance of SHJ solar cells with IMO:H films on the rear side. The JSC is the lowest of 38.79 mA/cm2 when the film fabricated without hydrogen under L- Fgas, while the highest JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 is obtained when the cells deposited with films at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas. Fig. 9 (a) displays the EQE of these cells with non- hydrogen doped films deposited under L- Fgas and IMO:H films deposited at 0.2 % fH2 under H- Fgas as rear side electrode, and the cells with latter clearly shows better spectral response in the wavelength from 1000 to 1200 nm. Since the solar spectrum reaching the rear side of SHJ cells are mainly composed of infrared light, the higher refractive index and reflectivity of IMO:H films under H- Fgas in the NIR region could Fig. 4.

Chen et al. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 267 (2024) 112727 6 improve the scattering of light and support stronger spectral response, thereby enhancing the JSC [39]. FF first increases and then decreases with higher fH2 under L- Fgas and further decreases under H- Fgas, and the series resistance of solar cells shown in Fig. 9 (b) is consistent with the parabolic change of IMO:H films’ resistivity in Fig. 3. A low resistivity of 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm is obtained with 0.1 % fH2 deposited under L- Fgas, leading to the highest FF of 82.18 %. It is well known that sputter damage has an impact on the performance of SHJ solar cells [40]. To investigate the impact of IMO:H sputtering on VOC, Fig. 10 shows the effective carrier lifetime (τeff) at the Fig. 7. (a) EQE curve of SHJ solar cells.

In our experiment, the thickness of n-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (n)) is about 20 nm, while the thickness of p-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H (p)) is approximately 30 nm. The thickness of nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) layer has a certain effect on alleviating sputtering damage thinner nc-Si:H layer suffer severe sputtering damage. Vividly, the curing process recovers the sputter-induced degradation passivation for cells with IMO:H on rear side, while the passivation for cells with IMO:H on front side did not reach the initial state, leading to a generally lower VOC when IMO:H applied on the front side. In addition, unlike the performance of IMO:H used as front side, the flat variation in VOC shows that hydrogen treatment during the formation of rear side IMO:H does not erode passivation effect, which may attribute to 10 nm thicker nc-Si:H (p) layer conductive to moderate the destruction of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), the degradation after hydrogen treatment sputtering is recovered after 200 ◦C curing. Finally, the champion solar cell with VOC of 744.45 mV, ISC of 38.93 A, FF of 82.18 % and PCE up to 23.81 % is obtained with rear IMO:H film deposited at 0.1 % fH2 under L- Fgas. 4. Conclusion In this study, high performance IMO:H films are fabricated by DC sputtering technique at room temperature, followed by 200 ◦C post- annealing. The structural, electrical and optical properties of IMO:H films has been investigated as a function of gas flow rate ratio of hydrogen (fH2) and total gas flow rate (Fgas). The experimental results indicate that all films feature preferential orientation (400) and lattice distortion is further aggravated under higher total gas flow rate. The addition of hydrogen in sputtering gases can enhance carrier mobility, and the film prepared with fH2 of 0.1 % at low total gas flow rate shows high mobility of 67.31 cm2V−1s−1 with lowest resistivity of approximately 2.59 × 10−4 Ω cm and relatively high transmittance in the wavelength range above 500 nm. When employing IMO:H films as transparent electrode in SHJ solar cells, the devices with hydrogenated films have higher JSC and the highest average JSC of 39.14 mA/cm2 are obtained finally, ascribing to excellent optical performance. Besides, when IMO:H films are applied as the rear side of SHJ devices, the solar cells were achieved the maximum PCE of 23.81 %, and the average PCE is 0.18%abs improvement compared to non-hydrogen film. The findings prove that hydrogen doped In2O3 based films provide the possibility of application in SHJ solar cells or other optoelectronic devices which require high transmittance and high mobility TCO films.

DOI: 10.1063/1.2711768 I. INTRODUCTION Near-infrared NIR-transparent conductive oxide TCO ﬁlms are attracting attention because of the possibility of widening spectral sensitivity of thin-ﬁlm solar cells from the visible to the NIR wavelength region. Indeed, an optical loss in the NIR wavelength region due to the free-carrier absorption in conventional TCO electrodes are drawing attention in Si or CuIn1−xGaxSe2-based multijunction solar cells, which are expected to be near-future thin-ﬁlm solar cells with high conversion efﬁciency. According to the Drude model, the increase of the transparency window to the NIR wavelength region without compromising the conductivity can only be obtained by increasing the mobility with decreasing carrier density. So far, Sn-doped In2O3 ITOhas been widely used as transparent electrodes, because ITO ﬁlms have high transparency to visible light and low resistivity can be easily fabricated at relatively low temperature. Generally, Sn has been regarded as the only useful dopant for In2O3; however, Groth reported high-mobility Ti- and Zr-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown on glasses by spray method in 1966, and high mobility of 120 and 170 cm2/V s under the carrier density of 1 1020 and 81019 cm−3 was obtained for Ti- and Zr-doped In2O3 ﬁlms, respectively.1 Recently, high-mobility and NIRtransparent In2O3 thin ﬁlms on glasses have been reported by doping metals such as Mo,2–5 Ti,5,6 and W,7,8 and demonstrated as a transparent electrode for a solar cell having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region.9 These ﬁlms also showed high mobility 80 cm2/V sunder the carrier density larger than 1020 cm−3, and the values of mobility are factors of 2–3 greater than those of ITO. We have also reported high-mobility 100−110 cm2/V sZr-doped In2O3 single-crystalline ﬁlms10 with carrier density of approximately 11020 cm−3, which were obtained by Zrdoping to the high-quality In2O3 using pulsed laser deposition PLDmethod.11 In this article, the deposition of Zr-doped In2O3 on glasses by sputtering method is described, and the structural, electrical, and optical properties of the ﬁlms are investigated. The inﬂuences of Zr-doping concentration on the properties are discussed with comparison to Zr-doped In2O3 singlecrystalline ﬁlms. II. EXPERIMENT In2−2xZr2xO3 thin ﬁlms were grown on glasses Corning 1737by radio frequency rfmagnetron cosputtering system EIKO Engineering Co.as illustrated in Fig. 1. As source materials, In2O3 and In1.9Zr0.1O3 ceramic targets with a diameter of 3 in. were used, which were aiming at the substrate from opposite directions with an angle of 60° to the substrate plane. The substrate was rotated for uniform ﬁlm deposition. The base pressure of the deposition chamber was below 5 10−6 Pa, and ambient pressure during growth was 0.5 Pa. Sputtering gases were O2 and Ar with O2/Ar+O2ratio of 0.0038. Each rf power ranged from 0 to 200 W, keeping the total growth rate at approximately 0.12 nm/s, which was aElectronic mail: t-koida@aist.go.jp FIG. 1.

Typical thickness of the In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms was approximately 270 nm thick; a 930 nm thick ﬁlm was also deposited in order to investigate the effects of ﬁlm thickness on structural and electrical properties. The substrate temperature was 450 °C, and, after the growth, the substrate was cooled down at the rate of 10 °C/min. The Zr composition xof the ﬁlms was analyzed by electron dispersive x-ray analysis. The crystal structure was analyzed by x-ray diffraction XRD. Electrical resistivity, carrier density, and Hall mobility were measured using van der Pauw’s method. Transmittance and reﬂectance spectra were measured by ultraviolet/visible/NIR spectrophotometers. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION −2XRD patterns of In2−2xZr2xO3 thin ﬁlms grown on glasses are shown in Fig. 2. For all the ﬁlms, the patterns can be indexed based on the unit cell of a cubic In2O3 JCPDS No. 6–416. As can be clearly seen in the 930 nm thick ﬁlm, preferred orientation growth to 211occurred, and no other impurity phases were observed, indicating that solid solution occurred in this composition range. The lattice constants as a function of x are shown in Fig. 3a, which were calculated from 222, 332, 431, 440, and 622peaks using the least-squares method. The lattice constants were almost constant and independent of x, probably due to the similar ionic radius between In3+ 80 p.m.and Zr4+ 72 p.m.. The lattice constants of 270 nm thick ﬁlms were larger than that of the bulk In2O3; however, it approached the value with increasing thickness. On the other hand, the crystalline size of the ﬁlms estimated from full width at half maximum values of 211 and 222peaks using Scherrer’s equation were also independent of x, as shown in Fig. 3b. Also, the crystalline size oriented to the 211direction increased with thickness, indicating preferred orientation to 211with ﬁlm thickness as mentioned above. Figure 4 shows the electrical resistivity, carrier density, and Hall mobility of the In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms as a function of x. In2−2xZr2xO3 single-crystalline ﬁlms fabricated by PLD Ref. 10are also shown for comparison. The dotted line is the expected carrier density assuming that all the Zr4+ ions substitute In3+ sites and generate one electron per Zr. The be- havior of electrical property of sputtered In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms as a function of x can be separated into three stages as follows: iIn the range of x0.01, the carrier density decreased with gradual increase in mobility. iiIn the range of 0.01x0.025, the carrier density steeply increased while maintaining relatively high mobility 80 cm2/V s. iiiIn the range of x0.025, the carrier density saturated and slightly decreased with gradual decrease in mobility. Accordingly, low resistivity 2.510−4 cmwas realized at x 0.02. The value of the resistivity is similar to those of commercial ITO ﬁlms; however, due to their substantially FIG. 2.

Downloaded to ] IP: 84.88.136.149 On: Fri, 12 Dec 2014 12:04:58 higher mobility and lower carrier density, the transparency extended further into the NIR wavelength region as described below. The behaviors of the electrical property as a function of x are quite in contrast to those of single-crystalline In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms, i.e., the carrier density followed the dotted line from x=0 to 0.005 and saturated at x0.01, while mobility increased ﬁrst at x=0.003 and gradually decreased with increasing x. In order to discuss this, Figs. 5aand 5b summarize the activation ratio of free carriers as a function of x and relationship between Hall mobility and carrier density for the polycrystalline and single-crystalline In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms, respectively. Here, the activation ratio was deﬁned by the ratio of measured carrier density to the expected carrier density, and the value over 1 might reﬂect the existence of additional donors by lattice defects oxygen vacancies12 or In interstitials13. Also, in Fig. 5beach symbol is connected by lines from x=0 to 0.038 for polycrystalline ﬁlms and from x=0 to 0.05 for single-crystalline ﬁlms. The dotted and solid black lines are the calculated mobility due to ionized impurities Iassuming that the conducting carriers originate entirely from doubly charged oxygen vacancies and singly charged Zr, respectively. The details of the expressions for I can be found elsewhere.14 Brieﬂy, the theory of ionized impurity scattering,15 which took into account the nonparabolicity of the conduction band,14 was used in this study to express the I for degenerate semiconductors, since the effects of the nonparabolicity of the conduction band16 were observed strikingly for carrier density over approximately 11020 cm−3.17,18 Here, the values of effective mass derived by Fujiwara19 for ITO was used and the value of static dielectric constant was taken as 9 for In2O3.20 For doped ﬁlms, mobility is supposed to be dominated by the scattering of electrons from ionized and/or neutral impurities, such as singly charged Zr, oxygen vacancies, In or oxygen interstitials, defect complexes, and so on.21 The scattering from grain boundary seems not to be dominant, because calculated mean-free path22 of free electrons at the Fermi surface in semiconductors ranged from 2.0 to 11 nm for the ﬁlm at x=0.0032 =6.410−3 cm, N=3.1 1019 cm−3, =32 cm2/V s, and x=0.022 =2.6 10−4 cm, N=2.91020 cm−3, =82 cm2/V s, respectively. The value was smaller than that of the crystalline size even in polycrystalline ﬁlms as shown in Fig. 3b. Regarding the single-crystalline ﬁlms, nearly perfect activation ratio 0.9was achieved at x0.005, and the mobility was close to the theoretical values dominated by singly charged ion scattering at a given carrier density solid black line, indicating Zr behaves as a good donor impurity, i.e., one Zr4+ substitutes for one In3+. Further increase in x resulted in the saturation of carrier density with a decrease in mobility, indicating the increase of electrically inactive Zr in In2O3, which did not generate free carriers and was considered to have negative effects on electron transport in terms of producing additional scattering centers.21 On the other hand, for polycrystalline ﬁlms, Zr did not activate in the ﬁrst stage, and the carrier density decreased with increase in mobility. The results indicate that Zr in In2O3 reduces the numbers of donor-type scattering centers. Indeed, the residual carrier density of the undoped sputtered ﬁlm was much larger than that of the single-crystalline ﬁlm, indicating the existence of many donor-type lattice defects oxygen vacancies12 or In interstitials13. Also, the slope of the increase in mobility as a function of carrier density as shown in Fig. 5bis similar to that of the calculated mobility scattered by ionized impurity as shown in solid and dashed lines. The mechanisms of the reduction of donor-type lattice defects by Zr-doping cannot be discussed only from these data; however, interactions between substitutional Zr and oxygen including oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygensmay inﬂuence them. In the second stage, the activation ratio gradually increased from 16% to 43% with increasing x, and the mobility exceeded the theoretical value dominated by scattering from doubly charged ions dotted black lineand approached the value dominated by scattering from singly charged ions solid black lineat a given carrier density, indicating that most carriers originated from singly charged Zr, and multicharged donor-type defects oxygen vacanciesand neutral defects are reduced with increasing x. Note that the sputtered ﬁlms 0.014x0.022positioned at the extrapolated line for the single-crystalline ﬁlms 0.003x0.01to a carrier density of over 1020 cm−3, as shown by a gray thick line in Fig. 5b. The results also support that the dominant scattering mechanism of free electrons is not grain boundary but lattice defects inside grains. In the third stage, further increase in x led to an increase in electrically inactive Zr in In2O3, which did FIG. 5. aElectrical activation ratio for In2−2xZr2xO3 ﬁlms as a function of x.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

However the value of I222/I440 ratio is higher for both the undoped and Nb doped films compared to that obtained for In2O3 powder (JCPDS File no. 712195). Figure 2 Intensity comparison of various peaks with corresponding peaks of powder data diffraction obtained for different films. The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Figure 3 Williamson-Hall plot for as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique on quartz substrate. The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al. [34], yields 117 optical modes at k = 0, the centre of the Brillouin zone and are distributed as [35] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 4 4 14 5 5 16 opt g g g u u u A R E R F R A E F IR = + + + + + Γ (3) where Ag and Fg modes are Raman active only, while the Fu modes are infrared active only. The Au and Eu modes are inactive in both Raman and infrared spectra. Figure 4 Micro-Raman spectra of (a) In2O3 powder, (b) undoped In2O3 film N0 and (c) 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N1. Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) depicts the XPS survey spectra of the N0 and N7 films scanned from 0 to 1000 eV. The survey spectrum of the Phys.

KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article Figure 5 XPS survey spectra of (a) undoped film N0 and (b) 7 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N7 deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. film N0 shows peaks of indium, oxygen and carbon whereas the survey spectrum of the Nb doped film (N7) shows the peaks associated with Nb in addition to these elements. As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM. The 3D AFM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films on a scan area 500 nm x 500 nm is shown in Fig. 7.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

Average transmittance of the films in the wavelength range 400–900 nm are calculated and given in Table 4. All the films show very high transmittance in this region (8186%). The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59].

The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films. The electrical properties of the undoped In2O3 and Nb doped In2O3 films prepared in the present case are compared with the reported values of Nb doped In2O3 films and other TCOs and the results are presented in Table 6.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Figure 3 Williamson-Hall plot for as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique on quartz substrate. The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al. [34], yields 117 optical modes at k = 0, the centre of the Brillouin zone and are distributed as [35] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 4 4 14 5 5 16 opt g g g u u u A R E R F R A E F IR = + + + + + Γ (3) where Ag and Fg modes are Raman active only, while the Fu modes are infrared active only.

Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

The cross sectional FESEM images show the formation of film of uniform thickness on the substrate. 5 Optical analysis 5.1 UV-visible analysis The degree of transparency and band gap of the films are determined from the optical measurements. The transmittance and reflectance spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. Average transmittance of the films in the wavelength range 400–900 nm are calculated and given in Table 4. All the films show very high transmittance in this region (8186%). The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59]. ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 0 p s t t D i i • • • - ¢ = + + ¢ -+ -+ ω ε ε ω ε ε ω ω Γ ω ω Γ ω , (6) where ɛ∞ ’ is the high frequency dielectric constant, ɛs is the stength of oscillator, ωt the frequency and Г0 the damping factor of the oscillator. ωp and ГD are the frequency and damping factor related to the plasma term respectively. The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths. Figure 12 (a) Stack model of the Nb doped In2O3 thin film sample for ellipsometry data analysis.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The complex dielectric constant can be calculated by the following relation [62, 63] ( ) ( ) ( ) r i h h i h = -ε ν ε ν ε ν (7) where ɛr and ɛi are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant, respectively. Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

Reshmi Krishnan et al.: Properties of RF magnetron sputtered In2O3 nanostructured films © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

However the value of I222/I440 ratio is higher for both the undoped and Nb doped films compared to that obtained for In2O3 powder (JCPDS File no. 712195). Figure 2 Intensity comparison of various peaks with corresponding peaks of powder data diffraction obtained for different films. The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Figure 3 Williamson-Hall plot for as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique on quartz substrate. The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al. [34], yields 117 optical modes at k = 0, the centre of the Brillouin zone and are distributed as [35] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 4 4 14 5 5 16 opt g g g u u u A R E R F R A E F IR = + + + + + Γ (3) where Ag and Fg modes are Raman active only, while the Fu modes are infrared active only. The Au and Eu modes are inactive in both Raman and infrared spectra. Figure 4 Micro-Raman spectra of (a) In2O3 powder, (b) undoped In2O3 film N0 and (c) 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N1. Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) depicts the XPS survey spectra of the N0 and N7 films scanned from 0 to 1000 eV. The survey spectrum of the Phys.

KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article Figure 5 XPS survey spectra of (a) undoped film N0 and (b) 7 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N7 deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. film N0 shows peaks of indium, oxygen and carbon whereas the survey spectrum of the Nb doped film (N7) shows the peaks associated with Nb in addition to these elements. As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM. The 3D AFM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films on a scan area 500 nm x 500 nm is shown in Fig. 7.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59].

The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films. The electrical properties of the undoped In2O3 and Nb doped In2O3 films prepared in the present case are compared with the reported values of Nb doped In2O3 films and other TCOs and the results are presented in Table 6.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

Figure 2 Intensity comparison of various peaks with corresponding peaks of powder data diffraction obtained for different films. The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Figure 3 Williamson-Hall plot for as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique on quartz substrate. The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al. [34], yields 117 optical modes at k = 0, the centre of the Brillouin zone and are distributed as [35] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 4 4 14 5 5 16 opt g g g u u u A R E R F R A E F IR = + + + + + Γ (3) where Ag and Fg modes are Raman active only, while the Fu modes are infrared active only.

Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

The cross sectional FESEM images show the formation of film of uniform thickness on the substrate. 5 Optical analysis 5.1 UV-visible analysis The degree of transparency and band gap of the films are determined from the optical measurements. The transmittance and reflectance spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. Average transmittance of the films in the wavelength range 400–900 nm are calculated and given in Table 4. All the films show very high transmittance in this region (8186%). The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59]. ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 0 p s t t D i i • • • - ¢ = + + ¢ -+ -+ ω ε ε ω ε ε ω ω Γ ω ω Γ ω , (6) where ɛ∞ ’ is the high frequency dielectric constant, ɛs is the stength of oscillator, ωt the frequency and Г0 the damping factor of the oscillator. ωp and ГD are the frequency and damping factor related to the plasma term respectively. The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths. Figure 12 (a) Stack model of the Nb doped In2O3 thin film sample for ellipsometry data analysis.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The complex dielectric constant can be calculated by the following relation [62, 63] ( ) ( ) ( ) r i h h i h = -ε ν ε ν ε ν (7) where ɛr and ɛi are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant, respectively. Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

Reshmi Krishnan et al.: Properties of RF magnetron sputtered In2O3 nanostructured films © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

However the value of I222/I440 ratio is higher for both the undoped and Nb doped films compared to that obtained for In2O3 powder (JCPDS File no. 712195). Figure 2 Intensity comparison of various peaks with corresponding peaks of powder data diffraction obtained for different films. The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Figure 3 Williamson-Hall plot for as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique on quartz substrate. The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al. [34], yields 117 optical modes at k = 0, the centre of the Brillouin zone and are distributed as [35] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 4 4 14 5 5 16 opt g g g u u u A R E R F R A E F IR = + + + + + Γ (3) where Ag and Fg modes are Raman active only, while the Fu modes are infrared active only. The Au and Eu modes are inactive in both Raman and infrared spectra. Figure 4 Micro-Raman spectra of (a) In2O3 powder, (b) undoped In2O3 film N0 and (c) 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N1. Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) depicts the XPS survey spectra of the N0 and N7 films scanned from 0 to 1000 eV. The survey spectrum of the Phys.

KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article Figure 5 XPS survey spectra of (a) undoped film N0 and (b) 7 wt% Nb doped In2O3 film N7 deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. film N0 shows peaks of indium, oxygen and carbon whereas the survey spectrum of the Nb doped film (N7) shows the peaks associated with Nb in addition to these elements. As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM. The 3D AFM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films on a scan area 500 nm x 500 nm is shown in Fig. 7.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

The transmittance and reflectance spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. Average transmittance of the films in the wavelength range 400–900 nm are calculated and given in Table 4. All the films show very high transmittance in this region (8186%). The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59].

The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films. The electrical properties of the undoped In2O3 and Nb doped In2O3 films prepared in the present case are compared with the reported values of Nb doped In2O3 films and other TCOs and the results are presented in Table 6.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction Over the years, investigations have been carried out extensively on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) owing to their diverse technological applications [1-3]. Among the TCOs, indium oxide (In2O3) has attracted great interest due to its wide band gap (direct band gap energy of 3.5-3.75 eV) [4], chemical inertness and good adherence to the substrate [5]. In2O3 is an insulator in its stoichiometric form and becomes conducting when it is non-stoichiometric [6]. In2O3 thin films have wide range of applications including transparent windows in liquid crystal displays [7, 8], solar cells [9], electrochromic devices [10], optoelectronic devices [11], gas sensors [12, 13] and nanoelectronic building blocks [14]. The optical and electrical properties of In2O3 show strong dependence on de- fect density produced by external doping or disturbed stoichiometry as well as their preparation and growth conditions [15]. Doping In2O3 by transition elements with high carrier mobility such as Mo, Ti, W and Nb can improve the optical and electronic properties considerably [16-21]. Niobium (Nb) can be a dopant for In2O3 because the substitution of Nb5+ ions into In3+ sites can produce more electrons which can enhance the conductivity in Nb-doped In2O3 films. Since the ionic radius of Nb5+ ions (0.064 nm) [22] is smaller than that of In3+ ions (0.080 nm) [23], the doping of Nb5+ ions in In3+ site can result in lattice deformation [24]. There are only few reports on Nb in In2O3 [21, 24-28]. Earlier reports show that Nb-doped In2O3 thin films possess high values of transparency, conductivity and mobility. Undoped and niobium (Nb) doped indium oxide (In2O3) thin films are prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 films are analyzed using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), microRaman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. XRD analysis reveals that the as-deposited undoped and Nb doped films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic bixbyite structure. Raman analysis supports the presence of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 in the films. XPS analysis shows a decrease of oxygen deficiency due to Nb and the existence of Nb as Nb4+ in the In2O3 lattice. The band gap energy of the films increases with increase in Nb concentration. PL spectra reveal intense UV and visible emissions in all the films. Optical constants of the films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The thickness of films estimated using FESEM and ellipsometry are in good agreement. The carrier concentration, mobility and nature of carriers are measured using Hall measurement technique in Van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. 2 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c Co-sputtered Nb doped In2O3 films are used as transparent anodes for organic solar cells by Kim et al. [24]. Nb-doped In2O3 thin films with high values of conductivity, mobility and transparency were prepared by laser ablation by Gupta et al. [25, 26]. Lozano et al. [27, 28] studied the effect of Nb doping concentration in In2O3 lattice at a substrate temperature of 550 °C using a co-sputtering system. Nbdoped In2O3 thin films were prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique by Mohammadi et al. [21].The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Nb on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of In2O3 thin films prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. 2 Experimental Nb doped In2O3 films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering technique. A mixture of In2O3 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) and Nb2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich 99.99% purity) with different doping concentrations viz., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% was well grinded and pressed powder was used as targets for sputtering. The deposition chamber was first evacuated to a pressure of 3x10-6 mbar and pure argon gas was admitted (at a pressure of 0.015 mbar) into the chamber. The deposition of the films was done on cleaned quartz substrates (kept at a distance of 5cm from the target) using an RF power of 120 W for a duration of 40 minutes. The as-deposited films with different Nb concentrations namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 wt% were designated as N0, N1, N2, N3, N5 and N7, respectively, and were used for structural, electrical and optical characterization. The structural properties of the as-deposited films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS D8 Advance) measurements employing Cu Kα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å in the 2θ range 20°-70° at a scan rate of 0.02° per minute in the Bragg Brentano geometry. MicroRaman spectra of the films were recorded using LabramHR 800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with Synapse CCD camera system maintained at -70 °C using an excitation radiation at wavelength 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser at a spectral resolution of about 1 cm-1. The chemical composition of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Omicron Technology) with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X ray source. The XPS data analysis was done using the CASA XPS software. The surface morphology of the films was characterized using atomic force microscope (BrukerDimension edge with Scan Asyst) in contact mode and field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova Nano SEM-450, FEI, USA) equipped with XFlash detector 6/10 (Bruker). The elemental analysis of the films was done using electron energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDSQuantax 200, Germany). Optical transmittance and reflectance spectra over the wavelength range of 200-900 nm of the films were recorded using a UV-Visible (JASCO, V550) double beam spectrophotometer. Thin film parameters such as thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient and dielectric constant of Nb doped In2O3 films were determined in the wavelength range 450-825 nm using spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16). The thickness of the films was also estimated from the cross-sectional FESEM images. The electrical resistivity, mobility, carrier type and carrier concentration of the thin films were measured at room temperature using Hall measurement (ECOPIA-HMS5000) technique in van der Pauw configuration. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the films were recorded using Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer equipped with 150 W xenon lamp. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films. The XRD pattern of the pure In2O3 film shows an intense peak at 2θ =30.59°, two less intense peaks at 2θ values 21.47° and 51.01° and two weak peaks at 2θ values 41.76° and 45.86°. These peaks can be attributed to lattice reflection planes (222), (211), (440), (332) and (431), respectively of cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide [JCPDS File no. 71-2195]. In the film with 1 wt% Nb (N1), an appreciable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks can be seen which can be attributed to the enhancement in crystallinity with Nb doping. In the films with higher Nb concentration, the intensity of the peaks decreases, showing the reduction of crystallinity at higher Nb concentrations. But the XRD intensity of film N3 shows a slight enhancement compared to film N2 which might be due to the higher thickness of N3 film. A regular increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (222) peak with increase in Nb concentration is observed which can be attributed to the stress introduced in the film due to Nb doping. The orientation of the grains in specific crystallographic directions is related with minimization of free surface energy density of the film and the energy density of the interface between the film and substrate [29]. From the high intensity of the (222) peak, it can be seen that <111> is the preferred direction of crystal growth in all these films. The (222) plane is a close packed plane in In2O3 cubic bixbyite structure with lowest surface energy [30]. The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to different lattice reflection planes obtained for different films with that of the powder diffraction database (JCPDS File no. 71-2195) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. A high degree of randomness for the peaks can be seen for the different films. The ratio of intensity of the most intense peak (222) to the intensity of other peaks is estimated for different films and the values obtained are shown in Table 1. In the XRD pattern of all the films, (222) peak remains as the highest intense peak and (440) peak is the second highest intense peak. A systematic decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% can be seen in Table 1. For the N7 film this ratio shows a slightly higher value compared to N5 film. The decrease of I222/I440 ratio with increase in Nb concentration can be an indication of the change in the preferred orientation of crystalline Phys.

However the value of I222/I440 ratio is higher for both the undoped and Nb doped films compared to that obtained for In2O3 powder (JCPDS File no. 712195). Figure 2 Intensity comparison of various peaks with corresponding peaks of powder data diffraction obtained for different films. The reported value of the lattice constant a for bulk In2O3 crystal is 1.0118 nm [31].The lattice constant calculated for all the films (Table 2) is in agreement with the reported value. The average size (D) of the crystallites in the films is determined using Scherrer formula [32] 0.9 cos hkl D = λ β θ , (1) where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle and β is the FWHM in radians. The average size of the crystallites is estimated using the data for the most intense peak (222). A systematic reduction in the size of the crystallites with increase in Nb concentration is observed (Table 2) and this indicates that Nb hinders the growth of the In2O3 grains [21].

The effect of crystallite size and strain induced broadening in the FWHM of XRD peak can be studied by Williamson-Hall plot (W-H plot) using the relation [33]: cos 2 sin k D = + ¢ λ β θ η θ , (2) where D′ is the actual particle size, k is the correction shape factor which can be taken as 0.9 for spherical grains, and η is the residual strain. The corresponding values of β and θ for the XRD peaks with significant intensities in the XRD patterns are used for plotting the W-H plot. From the W-H plot (Fig. 3), strain free crystallite size and strain in the films are calculated (Table 2). It can be seen that the size of the crystallites calculated from the W-H plot is higher than that calculated from Scherrer formula for all the films. This indicates that there is strain induced broadening of the XRD peaks in all the films. 3.2 Micro-Raman analysis In2O3 having bcc bixbyite structure belongs to the space group Ia3 with 8 formula units per Bravais unit cell. Four In atoms occupy S6 site, 12 In atoms occupy C2 site and 24 oxygen atoms occupy the general site C1. The group theoretical analysis, under the factor group Th using Fateley et al.

Deconvoluted spectra in the wave number range 215-630 cm-1 are given as inset in the Raman spectra. The micro-Raman spectra of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are recorded. Figure 4 presents the micro-Raman spectra of the In2O3 powder, as-deposited undoped and 1 wt% Nb doped In2O3 films. The deconvoluted spectra of the wave number region 235-660 cm-1 are shown in the inset of the Raman spectra of the films. The intense Raman band at ~133 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of In-O bond of InO6 structural unit [36]. A broad band ~308 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of all the films can be attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedron [36, 37]. In the Raman spectra of the films, the weak band at 369 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of In-O-In bridge and is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the structure [36]. The bands ~492 and 630 cm-1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of InO6 [13, 37]. The bands ~ 807 cm-1 obtained in the Raman spectra of the films may be due to the spectral contribution from the quartz substrate [38]. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the Nb doped films are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

As the films get exposed to the atmosphere, they have a detectable quantity of adventitious carbon contamination. The binding energy of all the spectra is calibrated with reference to the In 3d3/2 peak [39]. Figure 6(a) and 6(c) shows the In 3d core level spectra of the undoped film N0 and 7 wt% doped film N7. Gaussian fitting of the In 3d region in the films N0 and N7 shows double peaks with a spin–orbit splitting of ~7.6 eV. For the film N0, the two peaks are observed at binding energies 443.97 eV and 451.56 eV which can be attributed to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 peaks of In2O3 [40, 41]. For the film N7, these peaks are observed at 444.31 eV and 452.05 eV respectively. The observation of double peaks in the oxygen 1s spectra is common for oxides containing cations with multiple valence states [42, 43]. Banger et al. [44] fitted the oxygen 1s peak to a superposition of three Gaussian components with positions centred at ~ 530, 531 and 532 eV reflecting three different oxygen environments. They attributed the binding energy peak at 530 eV to lattice oxygen atoms in a fully-coordinated environment, the peak at 531 eV to oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy and the higher binding energy peak at 532 eV to M-OH (M-metal) species. The O 1s core level spectra of the films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(d), respectively. Gaussian fitting of the O 1s spectra shows two peaks at 529.07 eV(OI) and 530.97 (OII) eV for the film N0. These peaks are observed at 529.49 eV (OI) and 531.20 eV (OII) for the film N7. The low binding energy OI peak for the undoped film N0 corresponds to In2O3 lattice oxygen atoms [45]. For the film N7, OI peak at 529.49 eV can be assigned to the oxygen (O2-) anion in In2O3 or Nb-oxides [46]. Naeem et al. [47] attributed the high binding energy peak at 531.6 eV to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region. Luhin et al. [48] assigned the photoelectron line with a binding energy 531.9 eV to the surface adsorbed oxygen in various forms as well as to the oxygen incorporated in a hydroxyl group. Hence the higher energy peaks observed at 530.97 eV for N0 film and at 531.20 eV for N7 film can be due to O2- ions in the oxygen deficient region or to the surface adsorbed oxygen.

Deconvolution of the Nb 3d peak using CASAXPS software yields two components with medium intense peaks at binding energies 206.44 eV and 209.20 eV. These peaks observed with a spin orbit splitting of 2.76 eV can be attributed to the Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 peaks of Nb4+ [28]. This shows the presence of an oxygen deficient phase in the Nb doped film. Table 3 summarizes the peak positions and relative strengths of In and O. It is observed from Table 3 that In 3d and O 1s peaks of the film N7 is shifted towards higher binding energy. The intensity ratio of OII/Ototal for films N0 and N7 is ~0.78.

Due to the higher Nb-O bond strength, the higher will be the probability of capturing oxygen atoms during the deposition, and hence the lower oxygen deficiency concentration. 4 Surface morphology 4.1 AFM analysis The surface morphology and surface roughness of the films are examined using AFM.

This indicates the good crystalline nature of the film as evidenced from the XRD analysis. The film with 7 wt% Nb shows a tendency of agglomeration of grains. The root mean square surface roughness (rms) of the films is obtained using WSxM 5.0 Develop 6.4 software [50]. All the films present low values for rms surface roughness (Table 2) indicating a smooth morphology. 4.2 FESEM and EDS analysis The surface morphology of the films is also analyzed using FESEM analysis. Figure 8 shows the FESEM images of undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering technique. As revealed by the AFM analysis, the FESEM images also support a smooth surface morphology for both undoped and doped films. The FESEM images of all the films show a uniform dense distribution of smaller grains. The elemental analysis of the undoped and doped films is done by EDS analysis. The typical EDS spectra of two films N0 and N7 are shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The observation of Nb peaks supports the incorporation of Nb in the doped films. A systematic increase of incorporation of Nb with increase in doping concentration can be seen in Fig. 9(c). The cross-sectional FESEM images of as-deposited Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 10. The thickness of the films estimated from these images is given in Table 2.

The cross sectional FESEM images show the formation of film of uniform thickness on the substrate. 5 Optical analysis 5.1 UV-visible analysis The degree of transparency and band gap of the films are determined from the optical measurements. The transmittance and reflectance spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are shown in Fig. 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. Average transmittance of the films in the wavelength range 400–900 nm are calculated and given in Table 4. All the films show very high transmittance in this region (8186%). The high transparency of the films can be due to their good crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology. A smooth and uniform surface morphology reduces scattering loss. All the films show a sharp decrease in transmittance below 400 nm region due to the fundamental absorption edge of In2O3. Almost a systematic blue shift of fundamental absorption edge with increase in Nb concentration can be seen in the transmittance spectra. The oscillations observed in the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the films can be due to the interference of light arising from the difference in refractive indices of the film and substrate and multiple reflections at the two film edges i.e, film/air and film/substrate interface [51, 52]. These oscillations give an evidence of homogeneous films with a smooth and uniform film surface as evident from AFM and FESEM analysis. The absorption coefficient α at different wavelengths is calculated using the following relation: ( ) 2 1 1 ln R t T È ˘ -= Í ˙ Î ˚ α , (4) where t is the film thickness, R is the reflectance and T is the transmittance of the film. The band gap energy Eg can be estimated from the following relation [53]: ( ) ( ) n g h A h E = -α ν ν , (5) where α is the absorption coefficient, the constant A is the band edge sharpness which is related with the order in crystalline structure of deposited films, n is the Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of band transition which can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 depending on whether the transitions are direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions respectively [53, 54]. The plot of α2 versus photon energy (hυ) of asdeposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films is shown in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that for all the films, the best straight line is obtained for n = 1/2 indicating direct allow- Figure 11 (a) Transmittance spectra and (b) reflectance spectra and (c) α2 versus hυ plot of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films deposited on quartz substrate by RF magnetron sputtering technique. ed transition in these films. The band gap is determined for all the films from the plot of (α)1/n versus photon energy hν on the x-axis by extrapolating the linear region of the graph to hν = 0. The band gap energy estimated for undoped In2O3 film is 3.56 eV. The Nb doped In2O3 films present a higher value of band gap energy compared to that of the undoped film. A systematic increase of band gap energy with increase in Nb concentration upto 5 wt% Nb concentration is observed (3.56-3.69 eV); thereafter the band gap energy slightly decreases (3.65 eV). The shift in band gap energy may arise from several factors such as improvement or re- Phys. Status Solidi C (2016) 9 www.pss-c.com © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Contributed Article duction in crystallinity, quantum size effect, change in the density of impurities, tensile or compressive strain in the films etc. [55]. XRD analysis shows a reduction in crystallite size with Nb doping. The XPS analysis reveals that Nb-doped film is oxygen deficient. Thus, the observed shift in band gap energy with Nb doping can be due to the reduction in crystallite size and to oxygen deficiency concentration [56] in the films. 5.2 Spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis The optical constants being closely related to the electronic polarizability of ions and the local field inside materials play an important role in the design of optical devices and optical communication [57]. The optical constants of the Nb doped In2O3 films are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. For measuring the ellipsometric parameters psi (Ψ) and delta (Δ), transmittance spectra of all the films deposited on quartz substrate are measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon MM-16 ellipsometer. The Ψ and Δ spectra are acquired at an angle of incidence of 70º in the wavelength range 450-825 nm (2.75-1.50 eV). Optical modelling and data analysis are done using the DELTAPSI2TM software [58]. The ellipsometric data of the undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films are analysed by a three layer model of the samples as given in Fig. 12(a). The surface layer consists of In2O3: Nb and voids and the middle layer is bulk In2O3: Nb layer. The thickness and optical constants of the bulk layer are determined using a classical oscillator dispersion relation containing a single oscillator and a Drude term [59]. ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 0 p s t t D i i • • • - ¢ = + + ¢ -+ -+ ω ε ε ω ε ε ω ω Γ ω ω Γ ω , (6) where ɛ∞ ’ is the high frequency dielectric constant, ɛs is the stength of oscillator, ωt the frequency and Г0 the damping factor of the oscillator. ωp and ГD are the frequency and damping factor related to the plasma term respectively. The experimental and model Ψ and Δ spectra for the films with different Nb concentrations are shown in Fig. 12(b)-(g). The quality of fit is estimated by the value of mean square deviation (χ2). In the present case, the value of χ2 is less than 1 for all the films (Table 4) indicating the best fit between experimental and calculated data. Figure 13(a)-(d), respectively, shows the variation of refractive index (n), extinction coefficient (κ), real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant (ɛr and ɛi, respectively) of the Nb doped In2O3 films as a function of wavelength. The refractive index of all the films shows a systematic decrease with increase in wavelength showing normal dispersion behaviour. The rate of decrease of refractive index with wavelength is higher at shorter wavelengths (i.e. near the fundamental absorption edge) than at the longer wavelengths. Figure 12 (a) Stack model of the Nb doped In2O3 thin film sample for ellipsometry data analysis.

The refractive index of the films for a typical wavelength 550 nm is calculated and shown in Table 4. The values of refractive index for the films lie in the range 2.02-2.14 and are in good agreement with the reported values for In2O3 films [60, 61]. Among the Nb doped films, the film N5 has the highest value of refractive index. The extinction coefficient (κ) of all the films shows a decrease with increase of wavelength. For films of high doping concentration, the rate of decrease of κ with wavelength is larger for shorter wavelengths compared to that of longer wavelengths. The low value of extinction coefficient indicates very low optical losses due to absorption leading to high transparency of the films in the wavelength range considered which is consistent with the transmission spectra obtained for the films (Fig. 11(a)). The variation of ɛr and ɛi with wavelength decreases with increase in wavelength. It is observed from Fig. 13(c) and 13(d), the value of the real part of dielectric constant ɛr is greater than the imaginary part ɛi. The variation of ɛr with wavelength and the variation of n with wavelength follow similar pattern for all films. The variation of ɛi with wavelength and the variation of extinction coefficient κ with wavelength follow a similar pattern for all films. 10 R.

KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The complex dielectric constant can be calculated by the following relation [62, 63] ( ) ( ) ( ) r i h h i h = -ε ν ε ν ε ν (7) where ɛr and ɛi are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constant, respectively. Loss factor is calculated using the following relation [62] tan i r = ε δ ε , (8) where 2 2 r n = -ε κ and 2 i n = ε κ . It is found from Fig. 14(a) that the loss factor increases with increase of photon energy. The films with high Nb concentration has high loss factor compared to the undoped film. The rate of energy loss of electrons as they traverse the bulk or the surface are measured in terms of the volume energy loss function (VELF) and surface energy loss function (SELF) [64]. VELF and SELF are related to the optical properties of the material via the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant by the following relations [65]. 2 2 i r i VELF = + ε ε ε (9) ( ) 2 2 1 i r i SELF = + + ε ε ε . (10) The VELF and SELF of all the films show similar behaviour (Fig. 14(b) and 14(c)). The values of VELF and SELF increase with increasing photon energy. Also the values of VELF are higher than that of SELF at higher energy. The films with low Nb concentration have lower values of VELF and SELF compared to the films with higher doping concentration. The thickness of the films is also determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry. Good agreement has been obtained between the film thickness values determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross sectional FESEM images (Table 2).

It is reported that bulk In2O3 cannot emit light at room temperature while films and nanostructures of indium oxide give emission in the UV and visible region [66, 67]. Figure 15 shows the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation radiation of wavelength 250 nm. The PL spectrum of the undoped In2O3 film (Fig. 15(a)) shows a very intense broad UV emission at 397 nm with a shoulder peak at ~ 341 nm and an intense emission at 469 nm. The PL spectra of the Nb doped films (Fig. 15(b)) except that of the N3 film presents two intense bands at 366 nm and 469 nm. The PL spectrum of the N3 film shows emissions at 352 nm and 429 nm with reduced intensity. The intensity of the PL emission in the Nb doped films are much less compared to the undoped film and the N3 film shows the lowest PL intensity. Dai et al. [68] reported emissions at 392 nm and 468 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by chemical route. They have attributed the blue emission to the existence of oxy gen vacancies and UV emission to the recombination from the localized defect states or the quantum size effect of nanowires. In pulsed laser ablated In2O3 thin films, Beena et al., reported two intense broad PL emissions ~ 286 nm and 390 nm region [61]. Strong and broad PL emission peaks centered at 470 nm has been reported in In2O3 nanofibers [69] and nanowires [70]. Zheng et al. reported strong PL emission peaks centered at 425, 429, 442 and460 nm in In2O3 nanowires synthesized by the EDO method [71]. Blue emissions at 416 and 435 nm have been reported by Wu et al. for In2O3 nanowires prepared by carbothermal reduction approach [72].

Reshmi Krishnan et al.: Properties of RF magnetron sputtered In2O3 nanostructured films © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.pss-c.com physica p s s status solidi c The synthesized In2O3 films can have defects such as oxygen vacancy, indium vacancy, oxygen interstitials, indium interstitials, stacking faults etc. [73]. These defects would induce the formation of new energy levels in the band gap. The intense UV emission observed in the present case can be assigned to the transition of electrons from the oxygen vacancy energy level near the electron band edge to the valence band [74]. The visible emission from the Nb doped In2O3 films can be attributed to the defect related deep-level emission [75]. Figure 15 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of RF sputtered asdeposited (a) undoped In2O3 film and (b) Nb doped In2O3 films recorded using an excitation wavelength of 250 nm. The observed enhancement in the PL intensity for the undoped film compared to the doped films can be due to the presence of excess oxygen deficiency and bigger crystallites in it. Increased oxygen deficiency concentration is also suggested by the minimum resistivity shown by the undoped film. Bigger crystallites reduce the grain boundary density which in turn decreases the scattering of light [76]. 6 Electrical studies The electrical parameters obtained from the Hall-effect measurements of as-deposited undoped and Nb doped In2O3 films with doping concentration 3, 5 and 7 wt% are shown in Table 5. All the films show n-type semiconducting behaviour as electrons are the prominent type of carriers. The undoped In2O3 film possesses a carrier concentration of 3.49x1019cm-3.This high concentration of carriers in the undoped film can be due to inherent defects in the film [28]. All the films have carrier concentration of the order of 1019 cm-3. Doping Nb into In2O3 lattice improves the mobility of the charge carriers. The undoped In2O3 film has carrier mobility 8.6 cm2 V-1s-1 and for the N5 film it is16.8 cm2V-1 s-1. The undoped film shows an electrical resistivity of 2.08x10-2 Ωcm. As the Nb doping concentration is increased, the carrier concentration slightly decreases. Thus there can be a reduction in the density of scattering centers thereby increasing the mobility [77]. The decrease in the carrier concentration observed with Nb doping can be related to the reduction in crystallinity as revealed by XRD analysis [78]. This can reduce the conductivity of the doped films. The electrical properties of the undoped In2O3 and Nb doped In2O3 films prepared in the present case are compared with the reported values of Nb doped In2O3 films and other TCOs and the results are presented in Table 6.
