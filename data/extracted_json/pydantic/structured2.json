Ager, and Christophe Ballif* DOI: 10.1002/aelm.201600529 1. Introduction The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented entrance in both variety and volume of optoelectronic devices into the consumer-electronics market. With this growth, there has also been a transition to devices that offer attractive features such as semi-transparency, flexibility, stretchability, tactility, and energy With the development of new generations of optoelectronic devices that combine high performance and novel functionalities (e.g., flexibility/bendability, adaptability, semi or full transparency), several classes of transparent electrodes have been developed in recent years. These range from optimized transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), which are historically the most commonly used transparent electrodes, to new electrodes made from nano- and 2D materials (e.g., metal nanowire networks and graphene), and to hybrid electrodes that integrate TCOs or dielectrics with nanowires, metal grids, or ultrathin metal films. Here, the most relevant transparent electrodes developed to date are introduced, their fundamental properties are described, and their materials are classified according to specific application requirements in high efficiency solar cells and flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This information serves as a guideline for selecting and developing appropriate transparent electrodes according to intended application requirements and functionality. Dr. M. Morales-Masis, Prof. C.

Woods-Robinson Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720, USA efficiency. Most such devices with these attractive features require transparent electrodes that enable these functionalities. Sustainable fabrication of transparent electrodes with readily available raw materials and their recyclability are also important criteria for successful commercialization. This article reviews the status of the development of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic devices. In the first section, we list the relevant properties that these electrodes require for their intended applications, including transparency and conductivity. We also describe other factors that affect device operation or contribute to device efficiency. As an example, highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells can generate short-circuit current densities higher than 40 mA cm−2 that must be laterally transported to the metal contacts of the cells.[1] Such large photogenerated current densities require transparent electrodes that can carry the current densities over large surface areas without excessive power dissipation. The electrodes in some light-emitting diodes (LEDs) must also transport similarly large current densities. In the second part of this report, we describe the distinct material systems that simultaneously enable transparency and conductivity and that are available either at the laboratory or the commercial scale. In the third section, we classify transparent electrodes according to their applicability to various types of highly efficient solar cells and to organic and inorganic LEDs (OLEDs, LEDs). To this classification, we add the processing compatibility requirements for actual device fabrication and electrode integration. Because reviews on each class of transparent electrodes are available (e.g., on metal oxide electrodes for displays and thin-film transistors,[2,3] on properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs);[4–7] and on general properties of graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanostructures[8]), the last section presents transparent electrodes by mostly focusing on the technological development, applications, and our perspective on future developments of inorganic electrodes. 2. Application Requirements of Transparent Electrodes in Optoelectronic Devices Typical optoelectronic devices that require transparent electrodes include touchscreens, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), smart windows, most types of solar cells (e.g., thin-film silicon, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and silicon-wafer-based www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (2 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT heterojunction solar cells), OLEDs, and LEDs. In general terms, the electrodes in solar cells should simultaneously guarantee unhindered current flow out of a large device area and efficient light coupling into the active area of the cell.[9] Displays and OLEDs have very similar requirements for their electrodes: current flow in and light coupling out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that all optoelectronic devices have identical requirements in terms of optical transmittance-lateral conductivity properties.[10] However, optimal performance from each type of device can be achieved only by specific optimization of its electrodes, such as minimized contact resistance with the adjacent active layer of the device (e.g., by work function matching),[11–13] low-damage deposition processing,[14–16] conformal film deposition, stretchability and bendability,[17–19] or temperature stability. In this context, we present the main requirements for transparent electrodes in each type of device in Table 1. We note that lateral conductivity is evaluated as sheet resistance (Rsh = 1/σd, where σ is the electrical conductivity of the material and d is the thickness of the electrode). As a device-relevant parameter, Rsh is used for comparison of the transparent electrodes discussed in Section 4 rather than conductivity, which is an intrinsic material property. Because of the broadness of this topic, we hereafter narrow our focus to transparent electrodes for high efficiency solar cells, LEDs and OLEDs. 3. Material Systems for Transparent Electrodes Only a few material systems simultaneously offer optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In fact, there is always a trade-off between these properties, which fortunately can often be tuned for specific applications. The first and most traditional strategy for developing a transparent conductor is to find a material that intrinsically offers both characteristics, i.e., a wide band-gap material with n- or p-type conduction. Classic examples of n-type doped transparent conductors are Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), F-doped SnO2 (FTO), doped zinc oxide (ZnO), and cadmium oxide (CdO).[4,22–25] Conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) also partially offer both intrinsic properties.[26–28] A second strategy consists of dimensional engineering using conductive, but not necessarily transparent materials (e.g., metals or carbon-based materials[29]) and their arrangement in such a way that the system conducts in one direction and is transparent in the other. This is achieved by arranging the conductive material in either a very thin layer or a mesh of (nano-)wires.[8,30–32] The use of 2D materials can be considered as a third approach, with graphene as the most prominent material.[33–35] The latter material offers in theory inplane (ballistic) conductance, while being quite transparent due to their limited thickness. Also available are hybrid approaches that combine the properties of several material systems into a single functional electrode,[36–39] such as embedded metal nanowire networks in a dielectric matrix. Below, we consider three approaches that build on inorganic transparent electrodes developed in recent years, their fundamental properties, their fabrication processes, and their position in the market either as raw materials or utilized in commercial devices. To classify the electrodes based on its technology maturity we used the concept Monica Morales-Masis is team leader for transparent electrodes development at the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory (PVLab) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

The TRL are given in a range from 1 to 9, with 1 being the lowest level of technology readiness (at the scientific study stage, observation of basic principles) and 9 the highest level (when a technology reaches commercialization). As commented above, Table 2 focuses on inorganic materials, extensive reviews of the conductive polymer approach have previously been published.[26,28,40] 3.1. Transparent Conductors 3.1.1. N-Type Transparent Conductors Highly doped (degenerate) metal oxides, commonly known as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), are the most widely used and studied transparent electrodes to date. Conventional TCO materials are tin-, zinc-, cadmium- and indium-based oxides (SnO2, ZnO, CdO, In2O3). Other reported materials with TCO properties include titanium oxide (TiO2) and calcium aluminate (12CaO⋅7Al2O3).[42,43] Conventional TCOs are binary systems, mainly polycrystalline in nature and doped with halides, group XIII, or XV elements,[6] almost always forming n-type semiconductors. Recently, multi-compound oxides (e.g., IGZO, ZTO, IZO),[44] aiming at improved mechanical properties and thermal stability due to their amorphous nature, have also been widely studied and have electrical properties that are often on par with their polycrystalline counterparts.[44,45] The simultaneous ability of binary and multi-compound metal oxides to offer high optical transmittance in a broad photon-energy range and high electrical conductivity is attributed to their specific electronic structure. Conventional TCOs are mainly formed by metal atoms with the (n – 1)d10ns[2] electronic configuration.[44,46] Interaction of the metal s states (Ms) and oxygen p states (Op) results in the formation of a wide band gap (Eg > 3 eV), allowing the transmittance of photons in the visible range and below.[47] The valence band (VB) is composed of occupied oxygen 2p states, whereas the conduction band (CB) is formed by an overlapping Ms-Op-Ms network. This Ms-Op-Ms network results in a highly dispersed band (observed as a large curvature at the conduction band edge, see figure in Table 2, column 2, row 2) which leads to a low effective electron mass ( e * m ) in the range of 0.2–0.3m0, where m0 is the resting mass of the electron.[48] The electron mobility (μ) in dispersed bands in the relaxation time approximation depends on e * m and the average time between two scattering events (or carrier relaxation time) (τ), according to the following expression: e * e m µ τ = (1) τ is influenced by all possible scattering mechanisms relevant to electron transport in the films: grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials,[49] microstructural defects such as voids or stacking faults, point defects such as neutral or ionized impurities and lattice vibrations (i.e., phonon scattering). To increase the free electron mobility in TCOs, a low e * m , low free-carrier density and low-defective material are thus required. Typical TCO electron mobilities range from 10 up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.[3] The electron mobilities of polycrystalline and amorphous TCOs can be very similar. This similarity is generally attributed to the spherical symmetry of the Ms orbitals, which has a marginal effect on the angular variations in the Ms-Op-Msnetwork; this network forms the conduction band. The Ms-OpMs overlap (the cation-oxide orbital hybridization) plays a key www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Table 1.

KGaA, Weinheim (5 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT turn gives rise to a large dispersion of the conduction band and therefore a small e * m . Various types of indium-oxide-based TCOs also exhibit high electron mobilities, as discussed further in Section 4. The electrical conductivity (σ) is proportional to μ and the free-carrier density (Ne) as σ = eμNe. Ne can be increased in TCOs by doping; typically used extrinsic dopants are halides, group XIII and XV elements. Intrinsic dopants can also be used, with oxygen vacancies the primary example.[6] Intrinsically, the Fermi level (EF) lies in most known TCOs close to the conduction band facilitating extrinsic n-type doping. Such doping shifts EF inside the conduction band, forming a degenerate n-type semiconductor, which also leads to further widening of the optical band gap (Eg) following the Burstein–Moss relation: ΔEg≈ Ne2/3.[5,53,54] Free-carrier densities of TCOs range from 1017 up to 1021 cm−3 (for comparison, metals have Ne on the order of 1022 cm−3). Although increasing Ne can be beneficial to the optical transmittance in the UV-vis range (wider optical Eg), such an increase has negative effects in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum due to parasitic optical absorption by free carriers in the conduction band. This effect is called free carrier absorption (FCA), which is well described by the classical Drude theory.[55,56] The direct relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and Ne for the case of highly doped semiconductors is given by:[5,57] 4 2 3 e 2 0 3 e * 2 opt a e N c n m λ π ε µ ( ) = (2) where λ is the photon wavelength, n is the refractive index, and μopt the optical mobility. It is important to note here that the μopt might differ from the Hall mobility (μHall) since the former is not affected by macroscopic scattering effects as grain-boundaries or film dislocations. Therefore, in polycrystalline films, μopt is often referred as in-grain mobility.[56,58] Equation (2) indicates that FCA (AFCA = 1 –e−αd, with A the absorptance and d is the thickness of the film), will increase with Ne and d. To minimize FCA (a strict requirement for application in efficient solar cells), Ne should be reduced and μ maximized. The absorptance curves and their correlation with the electrical and microstructural properties of distinct TCOs are presented in Section 4 and Figure 2. A full derivation of Equation (2) is given in the Supporting Information. 3.1.2. P-type Transparent Conductors All high-performance TCOs used in commercial applications are n-type. Comparable transparent p-type conductors have yet to be developed. If made available, they could be used in a number of applications, including as electrodes that could offer carrier selectivity and enable carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, as interconnect layers (i.e., recombination junctions) in tandem photovoltaics and as electrodes for fully transparent electronics. There have been some reports of transparent p-type conductors in the literature but their conductivities and figures of merit remain orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TCOs (Figure 1). The difficulty in finding optimal p-type TCOs stems largely from the specific electronic structure of candidate wide-gap metal oxides, consisting of a highly localized oxygen 2p valence band with a large hole effective mass ( h * m > 1m0, compared with 0.2–0.3m0 for n-type) and thus a very low hole mobility, cf. Equation (1).[59] In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of most oxides is energetically situated deeply below the vacuum level, resulting in a high ionization potential. This impedes p-type doping, mainly due to compensation (i.e., “hole killing”) by intrinsic defect generation of the intentionally introduced p-dopants.[60] To improve the mobility by achieving high crystal purity (and minimal scattering), most p-type TCOs, like their n-type counterparts, require high synthesis temperatures that jeopardize their use in devices with sensitive thermal budgets. Fortunately, there are material design principles that can be employed to increase the mobility while maintaining wide optical band gaps in p-type metal oxides. The first such principle is to alloy a wide-gap metal oxide with Cu+1 to create CuxMyOz and then to hybridize the Cu+1 closed-shell 3d[10] electrons with O2p orbitals. This approach, which delocalizes the valence band and thus decreases h * m , was used to demonstrate the first p-TCO, delafossite CuAlO2, in 1997.[61] With a free carrier density of holes of Nh = 1.3 × 1017 cm−3 and a hole mobility at ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1, the conductivity (<1 S cm−1) was much lower than of n-type TCOs. Subsequently, other Cu-based delafossites with Al replaced by other metal cations, such as Cr,[62] Fe,[63] Sc,[64] and Y,[65] were investigated with oxygen intercalation and various synthesis methods (and thus, various microstructures) with the aim of decreasing the dopant compensation and increasing mobility (Figure 1). Recently, the CuCrO2 has been explored with promising results; Mg-doped CuCrO2 has the highest p-type conductivity reported for an oxide to date, 220 S cm−1. In related work cationic and anion substitution and the role of Cr vacancies in this material has been studied.[66,67] High conductivity has also been shown experimentally in non-Cu metal oxides, most notably spinel-structured TCOs, such as NiCo2O4,[68,69] perovskites-structured TCOs, such as SrInxTi1–xO3 and SrxLa1–xCrO3,[70,71] and amorphous or composite oxides, such as ZnO·Rh2O3 and In:MoO3.[72,73] Other oxides, such as doped Cr2O3 and Ba2BiTaO6, have promise but remain to be synthesized with high conductivities.[74,75] A second, more recently employed approach is to look beyond oxides. Interestingly, one of the first transparent conductors, discovered by Karl Baedeker in 1907, was a nonoxide, p-type degenerate semiconductor, CuI.[76,77] Non-oxide wide-gap (direct and indirect) semiconductors with P, S, or N anions are attractive candidates for p-type materials discovery as their valence bands are more delocalized, leading to a lower hole effective mass.[59,78] This approach has been demonstrated experimentally with Cu-based p-type transparent chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) and oxychalcogenides, most notably CuAlS2, BaCu2S2, BaCu2(S, Se)F, and Cu-Zn-S, resolving one of the issues with the localized O 2p orbital and, upon optimization, reaching conductivities greater than 10 S cm−1.[79–82] The Cu-Zn-S system (also notated CuyS:CuxZn1–xS) includes films grown at temperatures lower than 100°C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), achieving p-type conductivities approaching those of the n-type TCOs (Figure 1).[82] Additionally, Hosono and co-workers have www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (6 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT developed a new class of transparent layered oxychalcogenides LnOCuCh (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y; Ch: S, Se), with conductivities up to 140 S cm−1.[83,84] The transparent conducting materials discussed above present different challenges in terms of optimization and eventual device implementation. The majority of oxide-based p-type conductors discussed have low carrier concentrations (1017 to 1019 cm−3) and conduct via an activated transport or hopping mechanism. As a result, improving conductivity involves both increasing the electron density and the mobility. In the nonoxide chalcogenide-based systems, the band gap tends to be smaller compared to oxides. Additionally, the chalcogenidebased transparent p-type conductors are degenerately doped semiconductors with temperature-independent conductivity, limited by ionized impurity scattering. Compensation by deep donors can reduce both the hole concentration and the mobility, through the increase of ionized impurity scattering. This trade-off has been explored computationally for some specific oxide studies,[85,86] but a more general approach targeting non-oxides would be valuable. Phosphides and nitrides in general have lower hole effective masses, but are less transparent than oxides (phosphide band gaps are on the order of 2 eV). To circumvent this trade-off, a third design principle, proposed by Varley et al., among others,[78] is to explore systems with a low mh and a wide direct band gap. That is, materials with small indirect gaps could still be transparent in the visible so long as their direct gap is larger than 3.1 eV. Their study targeted and screened phosphides, suggesting further exploration of BP and AlP, among others. This approach was recently supported experimentally with pellets of CaCuP (with weak absorption at 2.2 eV and stronger absorption at 2.7 eV), showing conductivities up to 500 S cm−1, although thin films of this material have yet to be synthesized.[87] Figure 1 compares the conductivity of various high-performing transparent n-type and p-type conductors as a function of the synthesis temperature. It can be noted that at high values of conductivity the non-oxides tend to be more strongly absorbing due to their lower band gaps. Finally, as noted earlier, while n-type TCOs can reach high conductivity even in their amorphous state, p-type TCOs exhibit much lower conductivity at high synthesis temperatures. 3.2. Metal Nanowires, Nano- and Microgrids, and Ultrathin Films The use of metal nanowires (NWs) as transparent electrodes is based on the high metallic conductivity of the wires. The nanoto-micrometer-scale diameters of these wires allow the formation of microscale network grids that are sufficiently sparse to avoid dramatic shadow losses in the transparency. As a consequence, the conductivity of such transparent electrodes does not depend on intrinsic materials properties, as is the case for TCOs, but rather on the network density, quality of the nanowires and optimum welding of the network interconnects. In detail, a high density of NWs limits transmittance by increased reflection in the visible. A high aspect ratio (long, small diameter) with good crystalline quality (defect-free to avoid electron scattering and no nanoparticle formation within the wire to avoid plasmonic absorption) and a highly pure metal lead to high-quality nanowires, and passage of electrical current without contact barriers comes from optimum welding of the network interconnects.[88] Silver (Ag) is the most commonly used metal for transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity. Cu and Zn, as well as carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, have also been widely proposed.[8,89] Usually, these networks can be deposited gently on underlying structures, which can be an advantage for processing-sensitive devices, such as organic[90] and perovskite solar cells.[91] Challenges common to all NW network approaches are their poor chemical stability and tendency to oxidize, their large surface roughness, their weak adhesion to the substrate and high contact resistance to adjacent functional layers in devices. To overcome some of these challenges, NWs can be embedded in transparent dielectrics, conductive polymers,[92] graphene oxide,[93] and metal oxides.[94] Stability data on NW electrodes are not widely reported, but recent efforts indicate possibilities to improve the performance of transparent NW electrodes. The properties of Ag NWs, CNTs, and several other nanostructures for applications as transparent electrodes, optimization approaches and performance have been extensively reviewed in ref. [8,89,95] In relation to metallic networks, it is important to mention other recently proposed approaches. One consists of the formation of transparent conductive grid patterns by self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles deposited by ink-jet printing.[96] Another approach, closer to the standard one using macroscopic metal www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

These designs could redirect the light into the device avoiding shadow losses and forming “effectively transparent contacts”.[97] Ultrathin metal films have also been proposed as transparent conductors. Although these metal films have excellent electrical properties for thicknesses of only a few tens of nanometers, reflectance losses reduce the amount of light that couples effectively in devices, and the absence of a bandgap limits the transparency of the electrodes. Placing these metal films between two transparent, high-refractive-index layers reduces the reflectance of the metal, leading to gains in transmittance in the visible spectrum.[20] The optical absorptance and electrical properties of this type of electrodes are discussed in Section 4. 3.3. Graphene and Other 2D Materials Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely proposed as transparent electrodes, due to their atomic monolayer thicknesses (allowing high optical transmittance) and the possibility of ballistic transport, i.e., non-scattering of electrons even at room temperature. Of these materials, graphene is arguably the leading 2D material, which, despite its lack of a bandgap, was also quickly proposed as a potential transparent conductor.[98,99] A monolayer of graphene can have carrier mobilities above 10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1.[33] So far, such carrier mobility was achievable only in nanometer-scale, free-standing graphene flakes, obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and on films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on boron nitride substrates.[100] When transferring to substrates or upscaling the fabrication of graphene films, defects are introduced, thereby lowering the carrier mobility. Batch-to-batch production of high-quality graphene on large-area substrates, as well as the availability of transfer methods to obtain defect-free, highquality graphene, remain major obstacles in the application of graphene to commercial optoelectronic devices.[101] Moreover, despite its high mobility potential, the conductivity of graphene is low compared with more conventional transparent electrodes, largely because of its intrinsically low free carrier concentration (<1013 cm−3).[98] This may be resolved by impurity doping,[102] intercalation doping[103] and multilayer film growth,[33] all approaches that have resulted in device-relevant Rsh values. A clear advantage of graphene electrodes, like for metal NWs, is their tolerance to bending and stretching.[104] Therefore, for applications in which flexibility and stretchability are the most important requirements and a high Rsh is acceptable (e.g., foldable capacitive touch screens, see Table 1), graphene could be a good material candidate. In addition to graphene, other emerging 2D materials such as phosphorene[105] and stanene (a single layer of Sn, yet to be experimentally realized) have been proposed as promising optoelectronic materials because of their potential to be as transparent and flexible as graphene.[106] Further exploration in this field could lead to 2D-layered materials with the performance required for use as transparent electrodes in flexible, deformable, or even skin-like optoelectronic devices. Table 2 summarizes the above-described transparent electrodes, the property that allows both, conductivity and transmittance, the materials and methods used for fabrication, as well as their general position in the market. 4. Classification of Transparent Electrodes According to the Requirements for Solar Cells and OLEDs The two most important requirements of a high-performance transparent electrode are low optical absorptance and high lateral conductivity (low Rsh). When comparing transparent electrodes, we should remember that optical properties are dependent on wavelength. It is precisely this dependency of the optical properties on wavelength that largely dictates which transparent electrode is best suited to a specific application. Materials that feature low absorptance in the wavelength range at which the active part of the device absorbs or emits light most efficiently should be explored. In this section, we classify various transparent electrodes according to their Rsh and optical absorptance using the following methodology: a) The optical absorptance of different electrodes is compared instead of the transmittance. The reason for this is that the often-used optical transmittance is strongly linked to the reflectance of the transparent electrode, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the optical properties of the substrate, the film thickness, and the surface texture. In addition, while the transmittance is normally measured on a flat glass substrate, several solar cell absorbers feature textured surfaces (e.g., silicon heterojunction solar cells[1]) or randomly oriented grains (e.g., CIGS and CZTS[107]), which increase the roughness of the films and influence the reflectance of the layered stacks. To make an accurate and fair comparison of the amount of light that is parasitically absorbed by a transparent electrode, independent of the substrate and surface roughness, we therefore use the absorptance (A) value, defined as A = 1 – TT – TR, where TT is the total transmittance and TR is the total reflectance. b) The spectrally weighted absorptance (Aweighted,x, where x is the solar cell or OLED) of the electrodes is compared rather than the absorptance at a single wavelength. The spectrally weighted absorptance takes into account the relevant wavelength range and the intensity of the light source that is absorbed or emitted by the device. This is expressed by d d weighted, light, light, 1, 2, 1 2 A I A I x x x x x ∫ ∫ λ λ λ λ ( ) ( ) = λ λ λ λ (3) where A(λ) is the absorptance of the transparent electrode as a function of wavelength, Ilight,x is the intensity of the light source spectrum, and λ1,x and λ2,x are the wavelength’s range as defined by the application. In solar cells, Ilight,solar is the 1 sun air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum. The wavelength range (λ1 to λ2) depends on the type of solar cell. Here, we use the wavelength range from λ1 = 320 to λ2 = 1200 nm (Figure 2a), which covers the range of most of the solar cells analyzed here. In OLEDs, Ilight,OLED is the emission spectrum of a white OLED in the wavelength range from λ1 = 380 to λ2 = 780 nm (Figure 3a).

Transparent Electrodes as Front Contacts in Solar Cells Figure 2 shows the standardized terrestrial solar irradiance spectrum (AM1.5) under 1 sun intensity (a) and the external quantum efficiencies (QE) (left axis, b) for a range of archetypical high-efficiency solar cells that employ transparent electrodes, namely perovskite, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and perovskite-SHJ tandem solar cells. The absorptance curves of various transparent electrodes are presented in Figure 2b (right axis). Figure 2b shows that the front transparent electrode in any solar cell should have a sufficiently large (>3 eV) optical band gap to avoid absorption losses in the visible range of the spectrum. This requirement is already fulfilled by several TCOs.[23] For example, the optical band gap (Eg) of sputtered ITO, IZO and IO:H films are between 3.5 and 3.8 eV.[111] Transparent electrodes with low absorptance in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum (transparent electrodes with low FCA) are required for CIGS, SHJ and multi-junction devices, such as perovskite-onsilicon[109,112] and perovskite-on-CIGS[113] tandem solar cells, as these devices employ optical absorbers that are active in this range of the spectrum. These tandem approaches are new highefficiency photovoltaic technologies, with a potential to reach about 30% efficiency,[114,115] clearly underscoring the critical importance and urgency of designing transparent electrodes with exceptionally large broadband transparency. By comparing the absorptance curves of the TCOs in Figure 2b, we observe that hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H)[116] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 2. a) AM1.5G 1 sun irradiance spectra and b) quantum efficiency of a perovskite,[108] CdTe,[95] CIGS,[95] perovskite-SHJ tandem,[109] and SHJ[110] solar cells as a function of wavelength.

All transparent electrodes were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C to match the thermal budget of the solar cells. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (9 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT and cerium/hydrogen or tungsten/hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H, IWO:H, respectively)[117] offer the best optical properties, with an absorptance below 2% from 400 up to 1200 nm. Another notable TCO with minimal absorptance in the NIR-IR range is doped CdO[52] (not shown here). These TCOs have an excellent optical-electrical trade-off, potentially from their exceptionally high electron mobilities, on the order of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, combined with their relatively low free carrier densities. More specifically, in the case of IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H, the free carrier densities are usually below 3 × 1020 cm−3. Their electron mobilities are about 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IO:H and IWO:H and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ICO:H, resulting in Rsh in the range of 30–40 Ω sq−1 (Figure 2c), which are excellent values for high-efficiency solar cell applications. The high free electron mobilities in these polycrystalline hydrogenated In2O3-based materials are explained by the formation of large grains, together with possible grain-boundary passivation by hydrogen, as well as the fact that H atoms in the film do not contribute significantly to ionized or neutral impurity scattering.[118,119] IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H have been successfully applied in SHJ,[117,120–122] CIGS,[123] and perovskite solar cells.[124] Amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) is another TCO with low FCA and good electrical properties. Even with an amorphous structure (different from polycrystalline IO:H and ICO:H), IZO can have electron mobilities up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for free carrier densities between 1–3 × 1020 cm−3.[111,125,126] An attractive feature of these TCOs is that they already have excellent optoelectronic properties in their as-deposited state; these properties are not much affected by post-deposition annealing and offer opportunities for temperature-sensitive applications. A possible drawback is their relatively high absorption in the UV-vis range due to optical band gap narrowing.[111] This is a common effect in amorphous materials caused by exponential subgap tails due to disorder (also called Urbach tails)[127,128] and the presence of defects that introduce subgap absorption centers.[129] The application of IZO in solar cells has been demonstrated in SHJ[111] and perovskite solar cells.[130] A particularly attractive feature of all indium-oxide-based electrodes (including ITO) is the fact that their refractive index is close to 2. This is approximately the geometric mean of the refractive indices of air and typical solar cell absorbers (such as silicon), which gives these materials very good anti-reflective coating (ARC) properties.

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (10 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT ideal thickness is dictated by quarter wave-length conditions, corresponding to about 75 nm for the AM1.5G spectrum, ensuring a reflection minimum at 600 nm. Boron-doped ZnO (BZO) has attractive properties for certain photovoltaic devices as well.[131–133] A BZO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1 essentially shows the same low NIR-IR absorptance as IO:H (30 Ω sq−1), even though much thicker BZO films are required to obtain such results. Regardless of the thickness, BZO maintains its excellent optical properties for two reasons: low free carrier densities (in the order of 1019 cm−3) and a particular increase of electron mobility with increasing film thickness (due to its pyramidal shaped grains).[134,135] Electron mobilities up to 58 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in BZO films post-treated with H2 plasma.[136] The red curve in Figure 2b shows the absorptance of a BZO electrode with 10 Ω sq−1 Rsh. This very low Rsh is achieved by increasing the thickness of the film by 1 to 5 µm. Given the required thickness to obtain sufficiently conductive films, BZO films are not used as antireflective coatings. However, due to their self-texturing tendency during CVD, they offer excellent light-trapping conditions for thin-film photovoltaics, as evidenced by their successful application in thin-film silicon[137,138] and CIGS solar cells.[139] The absorptances of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) with 30 Ω sq−1111 and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with 15 Ω sq−1140 are already much higher than those of IO:H, IWO:H, ICO:H, IZO, and BZO. The high parasitic absorption in the NIR range of these materials originates from their high free carrier densities, required because their electron mobilities are lower than 40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Current losses linked to parasitic absorption in the front ITO in SHJ cells or in the front FTO in perovskiteSHJ tandem cells have been analyzed in ref. [140] and ref. [141], respectively. The popularity of both TCOs for application as window layers in solar cells is partly due to their chemical and environmental stability, as well as their demonstrated largescale production.[142,143] It is important to note that while IO:H and ICO:H are excellent electrodes for photovoltaic cells, they are still relatively new materials and their fabrication at production-relevant scales is yet to be demonstrated. One of the challenges for upscaling hydrogenated indium oxides is to control the introduction of water molecules during deposition (to include the H dopants). Approaches such as the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) would be, for example, a controlled way to grow high mobility IO:H.[118] With the obvious efforts to replace ITO with high-mobility TCOs, we expect the development of industry-relevant techniques for their fabrication. Aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes have also been widely used in PV devices.[144–146] AZO, like BZO, is attractive due to its non-toxicity and the abundance of Zn in the Earth’s crust. The low FOM value compared to, e.g., BZO, is due to the higher FCA in AZO. AZO is polycrystalline, with a columnar-like structure, forming grain boundaries that limit its mobility (typically on the order of 10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1). Postthermal treatments are known to improve the resistivity of AZO by increasing its free carrier density.[147] The electron mobility of sputtered AZO has been successfully increased up to 40–67 cm2 V−1 s−1 by incorporating a capping layer and applying a high-temperature (650°C) annealing step.[148] Considering the temperature restriction of several devices, low Rsh values are therefore mainly achieved by increasing Ne, at the cost of an inflated FCA. Although the FOM values for sputtered and chemical-bath-deposited (CBD) AZO are similar, deposition from solution presents some advantages: it is a simple and low-cost process,[149] and it is gentle, preventing physical damage to the substrates or active device layers where the material is deposited. Next to CBD, ALD and CVD are gentle deposition techniques as well and used for fabrication of several of the transparent electrodes discussed here. The ITO/Ag/AZO layer stack suffers the highest absorptance, from 500 to 800 nm, of all the curves compared. This is related to large reflectance and absorption losses in the thin metal film that provides the very low Rsh values. The shown absorptance is from[150]; however, approaches to improve the optical properties, e.g., by oxidizing the intermediate Ag film, have been demonstrated in subsequent reports.[151] While these films are not optimal for high efficiency solar cells, the possibility of sputtering these layers at room temperature, the limited total thickness of the trilayer-stack (<100 nm) and the ductility of the intermediate metal layer, with a thickness between 8 and 12 nm, make these electrodes interesting for flexible optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the high reflectance of these layers has been used to create a resonant optical cavity to trap the light in organic solar cells and, as a consequence, to increase their quantum efficiencies.[152] A summary of the approaches to optimize these types of dielectric/metal/dielectric layers for application in organic photovoltaic devices is found in ref. [153]. Finally, the absorptance curve of a monolayer of graphene, as reported in ref. [41], indicates that the use of such a material can be beneficial for applications in the NIR-IR range. However, in the visible range, the absorptance is already much higher than several of the other shown transparent electrodes. This is also reflected by the fact that a realistic Rsh value of 1000 Ω sq−1154 results in the lowest solar-cell FOM of all transparent electrodes, as shown in Figure 2d, casting doubt on whether monolayer graphene will ever find applications in highly efficient solar cells. As noted earlier, doping approaches and multilayers of graphene reduce the Rsh to more device-relevant values, but this is at the expense of increased absorptance.[41] Figure 2c shows normalized weighted absorptance as a function of Rsh for the various transparent electrodes compared here. Dashed lines of constant FOM are given for reference. These dashed lines highlight the observation that FOM converges for cases of very large Rsh values with very low absorptance or vice versa. Therefore, in Figure 2c we restricted the comparison of FOM values for transparent electrodes to a maximum of Rsh = 100 Ω sq−1, which is a relevant value for applications in photovoltaic devices. Figure 2d compares the FOM of transparent electrodes classified by thickness. The electrodes are sorted from left to right with the thickest electrodes, poorly suited for flexible applications on the left, and thinner electrodes, which present higher resistance to mechanical bending and stretching, on the right.[18] Note that Figure 2 considers a very general case by using only the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum under a 1 Sun intensity to evaluate transparent electrodes for any solar cell. To calculate the FOM for a specific solar cell, Equation (3) can be modified to include the quantum efficiency of the device: www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

Transparent Electrodes as Front Electrodes in OLEDs To evaluate FOM of transparent electrodes geared towards applications in OLEDs (a similar case would apply for bottomemitting LEDs), we use a white OLED spectrum simulated with SETFOS.[155] Figure 3 shows the white OLED spectrum used as Ilight (λ) in Equation (4) to evaluate the weighted absorptance of transparent electrodes. Contrary to solar cells, applications in LEDs, or OLEDs for lighting, displays or touch screens feature a narrower wavelength range at which the transparent electrode should have minimum absorptance, relaxing the optical requirements as compared with solar cells. In fact, effects such as the Burstein-Moss shift or FCA in TCOs have only a minimal influence on the parasitic absorption for these applications. Nevertheless, we can observe in Figure 3b that the absorptance of the TCOs still follows a similar trend as in Figure 2b,c, with ZnO:B, ICO:H, and IWO:H the transparent electrodes with the lowest absorptance and highest conductivity, and therefore exhibiting the highest FOMs. In this comparison, we have also included the case of a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) combined with metal grids embedded on a polymer matrix.[156] ZTO is an amorphous TCO, with sufficient conductivity to be utilized in combination with metal grids as the anode in large-area flexible OLEDs. In fact, it was demonstrated that with the same type of metal grids, ZTO devices performed better than the reference ITO OLEDs.[157] As observed in Figure 3c, the combination of the exceptionally low absorptance and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1 for ZnO:B, or even a lower Rsh (1 Ω sq−1) provided by the metal grids in the case of the hybrid ZTO + metal grid electrode, gives the highest FOM to these two transparent electrodes. The large thickness of ZnO:B, required to achieve low Rsh values, may prevent its application in flexible devices, however, as indicated in Figure 3d. For such applications, hybrid electrodes based on ZTO and metal grids may offer a better alternative.[156] However, in rigid top-emitting LEDs, ZnO:B, when grown by LPCVD, has the additional advantage of an intrinsic pyramidal surface texture with known light scattering properties,[137] improving light out coupling.[158] TCO/metal/TCO stacks and Ag NWs are on par in our FOM comparison. Although neither features simultaneously optimal Rsh and absorptance, these transparent electrodes offer properties that are interesting for flexible devices. For our comparison, we use representative absorptance and Rsh data of Ag NWs taken from the current literature.[8,95,159,160] However, we note that intensive research efforts are ongoing on Ag NWs, promising further performance improvements. Such improvements will mainly be achieved by increased fabrication control and deposition of metal grids with submicron-width lines,[161] development of hybrid approaches to improve stability under corrosive and oxidation conditions, as well as improved adhesion to the substrates. A monolayer of graphene with a sheet resistivity of 1000 Ω sq−1 gives, by far, the lowest FOM for photovoltaics. We note that for the case of OLEDs, the FOM is reaching a comparable value relative to other transparent electrodes in the list. This is because the absorptance values of the various transparent electrodes are comparably low in the relevant wavelength range for these devices (the visible light spectrum). Nevertheless, the 1000 Ω sq−1 Rsh associated with a monolayer of graphene raises the concern of high resistive losses when applied in devices. Hybrid approaches offer help in such cases. As an example, several laboratory-scale OLEDs and LEDs have used graphene-based electrodes, i.e., hybrid nanowires and graphene, conductive polymer and graphene and graphene oxide layers.[35,162] However, only a few groups have demonstrated the use of a single layer of graphene as the anode in small-area OLED devices.[163] 5. Other Specific Requirements of Transparent Electrodes for Solar Cells and OLEDs 5.1. Fabrication Compatibility As listed in Table 1, fabrication compatibility, i.e., processing temperature, chemical inertness, and non-damaging methods, is also an important selection criterion for transparent electrodes to be used in specific devices. For example, the thermal budget of OLEDs, SHJ, CIGS, CdTe, and perovskite-based solar cells is below 200 °C.[164,165] Clearly, fabrication of transparent electrodes on plastic flexible substrates also requires strict fabrication temperatures below approximately 150 °C. In this context, all electrodes depicted in Figure 2 and 3 were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C, during both deposition and post-deposition annealing (when applicable). The only exception is FTO, which is normally deposited or post-treated at temperatures well above 200 °C.[166–168] Amorphous TCOs such as IZO, offer the greatest flexibility, as they can be deposited nominally at room temperature and do not require post-deposition annealing. Such TCOs have demonstrated their value in SHJ and perovskite solar cell fabrication.[111,130] As mentioned earlier, gentle deposition on underlying layers can also be a critical factor in electrode choice and raises questions about the use of well-established physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition for certain applications. Sputter damage, caused by UV radiation and particle bombardment, is a known phenomenon in organic,[16] SHJ,[15] and perovskite[169] solar cells as well as flexible displays. Solutions to overcome such damage include the use of remote plasma sources,[170] the use of gently deposited buffer layers[171] or further improvements to solution-based deposition processes to improve the density and purity of TCO films to achieve high electron mobilities at low temperatures.[45,172] 5.2. Interfaces with the Transparent Electrodes Good electrical and chemical matching at the interface between transparent electrodes and their adjacent layers in a device is another criterion for electrode selection and optimization. This interface can be shared with the carrier-collection or carrier-injection layers, but also with the metal grid of the device. www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (12 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT Large-area optoelectronic devices often require a metal grid, which is normally deposited on the transparent electrode, to minimize the lateral resistance and, thus, voltage loss over large areas. As an example, we present a sketch of a cross section of a SHJ solar cell in Figure 4 to highlight the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/TCO/metal interfaces with the corresponding band diagram. Transversely, minimizing electrical losses is equally important. Again, in SHJ solar cells, the main contributors to such transverse resistance are the contact resistances (ρc) at the metal/TCO interface (label 1 in Figure 4b) and, even more so, at the TCO/a-Si:H interface (label 3 in Figure 4b); the intrinsic resistance of the TCO in the transverse direction (label 2 in Figure 4b) is usually sufficiently low to be neglected. Across the metal/TCO interface, the dominant carrier transport mechanism is field emission, for which the contact resistivity (ρc) is expressed as exp with E = 4 field emission c B * 0 E qh N m e ρ φ π ε ε ( ) ∝     ∞ (6) where φB is the barrier height and E is the tunneling energy.[174] This equation makes evident the improvement in ρc from the increased carrier density, Ne, of the transparent electrode, which suggests the use of bilayer TCOs that feature high surface but low bulk Ne to minimize ρc and FCA simultaneously.[121] Practically, the TCO/metal contact resistance is commonly characterized by the transfer length method (TLM).[175] In terms of metallization, screen-printed, low-temperature Ag pastes are commonly used, especially in industry. In such a case, ρc values on the order of 10−5 Ω cm[2] are typical, as is the case of the ITO/Ag and a-IZO/Ag interfaces, commonly used in solar cells.[111,176] Electroplated Cu can offer advantages in terms of line resistivity and material cost compared with printed Ag electrodes. However, due to the ease of diffusing electroplated Cu into silicon, where it can act as a carrier lifetime killer, its application to photovoltaics is not evident. Interestingly, ITO forms an excellent Cu diffusion barrier. The low measuredρc value for the Cu/ITO interface (ρc < 10−4 cm−3) validates this combination for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.[176] Contrary to the case of TCOs, achievement of sufficiently low ρc between the metal and Ag NWs or graphene electrodes is still an unresolved challenge.[100] To extract or inject carriers efficiently in solar cells or OLEDs, respectively, the interface between the transparent electrode and the active layer of the device (absorber or emitter) should have a negligible contact resistance (ρc) as well.[177] A main cause of this resistance is the combined effect of Fermi-level pinning at the interface and work function mismatch between adjacent materials.[177] This causes the formation of an interfacial energy barrier, characterized by a certain height and depletion width penetrating both materials. Such barriers can in principle be overcome by thermionic (field) emission, evidenced by lowered ρc values with increasing operating temperatures.[178] The barrier width can also be narrowed by increasing surface doping to increase field emission across the interface, similar to the metal/TCO case. As an alternative to doping, the work function of TCOs can be modified by surface treatments (UV, ozone, oxygen plasma),[179] or by the application of specific interfacial buffer layers with optimized work functions. The work function and band alignment of various TCOs for selected devices have been studied by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).[11,12,180] A selected list of TCOs and metals with their respective work function values as reported in literature is found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). In metal NWs and graphene electrodes, the work function cannot be intrinsically modified; however, a common approach is the application of a capping layer or creating hybrid electrodes with high or low work function polymers[177] or metal oxide films.[181,182] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

The first barrier is caused by band offsets. The second one can be caused by Fermi-level pinning at the interface and insufficient doping of a-Si:H and TCO. Because the TCO is normally n-type, an Ohmic contact for electrons is in principle guaranteed on the rear side. Transport at the TCO(n)/a-Si:H(p) interface occurs by band-to-band tunneling with photogenerated holes efficiently recombining with electrons from the TCO.[173] © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Stability Under Thermal and Humid Environments Environmental stability of transparent electrodes is also of critical importance when integrating them in devices. Damp heat tests performed under standard conditions of 85% humidity at 85°C for prolonged time (1000 h) were used to demonstrate the high environmental stability of ITO and IZO electrodes.[183] IO:H and AZO, on the contrary, showed poorer electrical stability under damp heat conditions mainly due to the introduction of water at grain boundaries.[183,184] In the case of IO:H it has been recently demonstrated that damp heat degradation is strongly linked to the hydrogen content in the films. IO:H films with hydrogen content lower than 5 at.% exhibit stable electrical properties after exposure to DH conditions.[185] The application of capping layers, e.g., capping IO:H with a very thin and dense layer of ITO, improves the environmental stability of the electrodes.[183] In terms of thermal stability, full-device fabrication might require temperature steps that could modify the carrier density or microstructure in TCOs, degrading the optoelectronic properties. TCOs with good temperature stability are mainly multicompound amorphous materials, such as IZO and ZTO.[125,186] In nanowire networks, clustering of the network due to a temperature step would increase the roughness of the electrode and induce the formation of shorts in e.g. organic devices. In addition to temperature, UV exposure may also detrimentally affect some transparent electrodes. Conductive polymers used in organic devices and hybrid electrodes, such as nanowire-based and metal grids embedded in a conductive polymer, yellow with exposure to UV and temperature.[187] In terms of chemical stability, cleaning of the substrate before OLED or perovskite cell deposition can cause damage to the transparent electrodes. SnO2, ITO, and a-ZnSnO are among the TCOs with the highest chemical stabilities[146] and therefore are fully compatible with industry-based processes to fabricate, e.g., OLED devices.[157] 6. Perspectives The continuous drive to increase solar cell efficiency, as well as the push for improved performance of several other optoelectronic devices, requires the development of transparent electrodes with next-generation requirements, including ultrahigh broadband transparency, high conductivity, adaptability, and composition mainly from abundant elements. The best example of a device that requires premium broadband transparent electrodes on its front is the perovskite-silicon multi-junction solar cell, which, as indicated in Figure 2, aims at active absorption of the broadest photon-energy range. The electrodes in this type of solar cell need to feature a wide band gap, low FCA, and relatively low sheet resistivity. In addition, they should be deposited without damaging the carrier-selective contacts in the silicon cell, or the perovskite layers, and cannot be annealed. The best solution for this is a very high mobility TCO, deposited at room-temperature using a gentle deposition technique. Amorphous indium-based TCOs are the best candidates; however, widening of their band gap remains a challenge. Further exploration of materials to find the right dopants or compounds that open up the band gap or of new material systems with tuned compositions and microstructures is just one path to the discovery of amorphous low-temperature and gently-deposited high mobility broadband transparent electrodes. In terms of deposition, further development of high-end deposition techniques, such as ALD, low-temperature solution-based deposition processes, or new PVD system designs that avoid the direct exposure of the substrate to the plasma during deposition (e.g., high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation,[188,189] or facing target sputtering[190]), is just one path to the development of ultra-high performance TCOs and TCOs/ device interfaces. Material design is also expected to play a decisive role in the development of Earth-abundant transparent electrodes, as well as for the discovery of high-performance transparent and conductive materials especially with p-type conductivity. Much is expected from high-throughput screenings using the combination of computational and experimental methods, looking for new design principles and experimenting with various synthesis approaches. On the p-type TCO side, recent investigations of metal-based oxysulfides or non-oxide chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) or pnictides (N, P) as potential p-type transparent conducting candidates show promise in reducing the hole effective mass and to increase conductivity. Recent progress on sulfide-based p-type transparent conductors has enabled device demonstrations that employ p-type transparent contacts. For example, low-temperature synthesized Cu-Zn-S has been applied as a hole-selective contact in solar cells with n-type absorbers.[81] The scalability and low processing temperature of these p-type transparent conductors merits further material and device exploration. Aside from transparency and conductivity, other specific properties (stretchability, self-healing, antibacterial properties) of transparent electrodes are becoming increasingly important as they are being implemented into thin, lightweight and wearable devices that require both ease-of-use and robustness. Examples of these are fiber-like electrodes,[191,192] consisting of fully integrated conductive fibers with a transparent matrix or skin-integrated circuits and optoelectronics that require transparent electrodes fabricated with non-toxic and biocompatible materials. The combination of optoelectronic and environmental or mechanical requirements is in many cases best achieved by hybrid approaches that integrate polymers and high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Lastly, in addition to the three different approaches to create transparent electrodes presented earlier in the manuscript, a largely unexplored area is the use of photonic crystals and metamaterials. In this case, light management through structures with metallic conductivity could simultaneously provide transparency and charge transport, creating transparent conductive structures.

Ager, and Christophe Ballif* DOI: 10.1002/aelm.201600529 1. Introduction The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented entrance in both variety and volume of optoelectronic devices into the consumer-electronics market. With this growth, there has also been a transition to devices that offer attractive features such as semi-transparency, flexibility, stretchability, tactility, and energy With the development of new generations of optoelectronic devices that combine high performance and novel functionalities (e.g., flexibility/bendability, adaptability, semi or full transparency), several classes of transparent electrodes have been developed in recent years. These range from optimized transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), which are historically the most commonly used transparent electrodes, to new electrodes made from nano- and 2D materials (e.g., metal nanowire networks and graphene), and to hybrid electrodes that integrate TCOs or dielectrics with nanowires, metal grids, or ultrathin metal films. Here, the most relevant transparent electrodes developed to date are introduced, their fundamental properties are described, and their materials are classified according to specific application requirements in high efficiency solar cells and flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This information serves as a guideline for selecting and developing appropriate transparent electrodes according to intended application requirements and functionality. Dr. M. Morales-Masis, Prof. C.

Woods-Robinson Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720, USA efficiency. Most such devices with these attractive features require transparent electrodes that enable these functionalities. Sustainable fabrication of transparent electrodes with readily available raw materials and their recyclability are also important criteria for successful commercialization. This article reviews the status of the development of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic devices. In the first section, we list the relevant properties that these electrodes require for their intended applications, including transparency and conductivity. We also describe other factors that affect device operation or contribute to device efficiency. As an example, highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells can generate short-circuit current densities higher than 40 mA cm−2 that must be laterally transported to the metal contacts of the cells.[1] Such large photogenerated current densities require transparent electrodes that can carry the current densities over large surface areas without excessive power dissipation. The electrodes in some light-emitting diodes (LEDs) must also transport similarly large current densities. In the second part of this report, we describe the distinct material systems that simultaneously enable transparency and conductivity and that are available either at the laboratory or the commercial scale. In the third section, we classify transparent electrodes according to their applicability to various types of highly efficient solar cells and to organic and inorganic LEDs (OLEDs, LEDs). To this classification, we add the processing compatibility requirements for actual device fabrication and electrode integration. Because reviews on each class of transparent electrodes are available (e.g., on metal oxide electrodes for displays and thin-film transistors,[2,3] on properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs);[4–7] and on general properties of graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanostructures[8]), the last section presents transparent electrodes by mostly focusing on the technological development, applications, and our perspective on future developments of inorganic electrodes. 2. Application Requirements of Transparent Electrodes in Optoelectronic Devices Typical optoelectronic devices that require transparent electrodes include touchscreens, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), smart windows, most types of solar cells (e.g., thin-film silicon, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and silicon-wafer-based www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (2 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT heterojunction solar cells), OLEDs, and LEDs. In general terms, the electrodes in solar cells should simultaneously guarantee unhindered current flow out of a large device area and efficient light coupling into the active area of the cell.[9] Displays and OLEDs have very similar requirements for their electrodes: current flow in and light coupling out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that all optoelectronic devices have identical requirements in terms of optical transmittance-lateral conductivity properties.[10] However, optimal performance from each type of device can be achieved only by specific optimization of its electrodes, such as minimized contact resistance with the adjacent active layer of the device (e.g., by work function matching),[11–13] low-damage deposition processing,[14–16] conformal film deposition, stretchability and bendability,[17–19] or temperature stability. In this context, we present the main requirements for transparent electrodes in each type of device in Table 1. We note that lateral conductivity is evaluated as sheet resistance (Rsh = 1/σd, where σ is the electrical conductivity of the material and d is the thickness of the electrode). As a device-relevant parameter, Rsh is used for comparison of the transparent electrodes discussed in Section 4 rather than conductivity, which is an intrinsic material property. Because of the broadness of this topic, we hereafter narrow our focus to transparent electrodes for high efficiency solar cells, LEDs and OLEDs. 3. Material Systems for Transparent Electrodes Only a few material systems simultaneously offer optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In fact, there is always a trade-off between these properties, which fortunately can often be tuned for specific applications. The first and most traditional strategy for developing a transparent conductor is to find a material that intrinsically offers both characteristics, i.e., a wide band-gap material with n- or p-type conduction. Classic examples of n-type doped transparent conductors are Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), F-doped SnO2 (FTO), doped zinc oxide (ZnO), and cadmium oxide (CdO).[4,22–25] Conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) also partially offer both intrinsic properties.[26–28] A second strategy consists of dimensional engineering using conductive, but not necessarily transparent materials (e.g., metals or carbon-based materials[29]) and their arrangement in such a way that the system conducts in one direction and is transparent in the other. This is achieved by arranging the conductive material in either a very thin layer or a mesh of (nano-)wires.[8,30–32] The use of 2D materials can be considered as a third approach, with graphene as the most prominent material.[33–35] The latter material offers in theory inplane (ballistic) conductance, while being quite transparent due to their limited thickness. Also available are hybrid approaches that combine the properties of several material systems into a single functional electrode,[36–39] such as embedded metal nanowire networks in a dielectric matrix. Below, we consider three approaches that build on inorganic transparent electrodes developed in recent years, their fundamental properties, their fabrication processes, and their position in the market either as raw materials or utilized in commercial devices. To classify the electrodes based on its technology maturity we used the concept Monica Morales-Masis is team leader for transparent electrodes development at the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory (PVLab) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

The TRL are given in a range from 1 to 9, with 1 being the lowest level of technology readiness (at the scientific study stage, observation of basic principles) and 9 the highest level (when a technology reaches commercialization). As commented above, Table 2 focuses on inorganic materials, extensive reviews of the conductive polymer approach have previously been published.[26,28,40] 3.1. Transparent Conductors 3.1.1. N-Type Transparent Conductors Highly doped (degenerate) metal oxides, commonly known as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), are the most widely used and studied transparent electrodes to date. Conventional TCO materials are tin-, zinc-, cadmium- and indium-based oxides (SnO2, ZnO, CdO, In2O3). Other reported materials with TCO properties include titanium oxide (TiO2) and calcium aluminate (12CaO⋅7Al2O3).[42,43] Conventional TCOs are binary systems, mainly polycrystalline in nature and doped with halides, group XIII, or XV elements,[6] almost always forming n-type semiconductors. Recently, multi-compound oxides (e.g., IGZO, ZTO, IZO),[44] aiming at improved mechanical properties and thermal stability due to their amorphous nature, have also been widely studied and have electrical properties that are often on par with their polycrystalline counterparts.[44,45] The simultaneous ability of binary and multi-compound metal oxides to offer high optical transmittance in a broad photon-energy range and high electrical conductivity is attributed to their specific electronic structure. Conventional TCOs are mainly formed by metal atoms with the (n – 1)d10ns[2] electronic configuration.[44,46] Interaction of the metal s states (Ms) and oxygen p states (Op) results in the formation of a wide band gap (Eg > 3 eV), allowing the transmittance of photons in the visible range and below.[47] The valence band (VB) is composed of occupied oxygen 2p states, whereas the conduction band (CB) is formed by an overlapping Ms-Op-Ms network. This Ms-Op-Ms network results in a highly dispersed band (observed as a large curvature at the conduction band edge, see figure in Table 2, column 2, row 2) which leads to a low effective electron mass ( e * m ) in the range of 0.2–0.3m0, where m0 is the resting mass of the electron.[48] The electron mobility (μ) in dispersed bands in the relaxation time approximation depends on e * m and the average time between two scattering events (or carrier relaxation time) (τ), according to the following expression: e * e m µ τ = (1) τ is influenced by all possible scattering mechanisms relevant to electron transport in the films: grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials,[49] microstructural defects such as voids or stacking faults, point defects such as neutral or ionized impurities and lattice vibrations (i.e., phonon scattering). To increase the free electron mobility in TCOs, a low e * m , low free-carrier density and low-defective material are thus required. Typical TCO electron mobilities range from 10 up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.[3] The electron mobilities of polycrystalline and amorphous TCOs can be very similar. This similarity is generally attributed to the spherical symmetry of the Ms orbitals, which has a marginal effect on the angular variations in the Ms-Op-Msnetwork; this network forms the conduction band. The Ms-OpMs overlap (the cation-oxide orbital hybridization) plays a key www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Table 1.

This octahedral coordination ensures a large Ms-Op overlap, which in www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Table 2. Types of transparent conductive electrodes. The properties that allow simultaneous transmittance and conductivity, i.e., wide band gap and degeneration conduction in n-type TCOs (first two rows in column 2), metallic conduction by percolation through sparse nanowire networks (first two rows in column 3), and ballistic transport in the specific case of a monolayer of graphene, allowing transparency because of its 1-atom thickness (row 2, column 4).[41] The materials and deposition techniques used to fabricate these transparent electrodes are listed along with their market readiness and estimated technology readiness level (TRL). © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (5 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT turn gives rise to a large dispersion of the conduction band and therefore a small e * m . Various types of indium-oxide-based TCOs also exhibit high electron mobilities, as discussed further in Section 4. The electrical conductivity (σ) is proportional to μ and the free-carrier density (Ne) as σ = eμNe. Ne can be increased in TCOs by doping; typically used extrinsic dopants are halides, group XIII and XV elements. Intrinsic dopants can also be used, with oxygen vacancies the primary example.[6] Intrinsically, the Fermi level (EF) lies in most known TCOs close to the conduction band facilitating extrinsic n-type doping. Such doping shifts EF inside the conduction band, forming a degenerate n-type semiconductor, which also leads to further widening of the optical band gap (Eg) following the Burstein–Moss relation: ΔEg≈ Ne2/3.[5,53,54] Free-carrier densities of TCOs range from 1017 up to 1021 cm−3 (for comparison, metals have Ne on the order of 1022 cm−3). Although increasing Ne can be beneficial to the optical transmittance in the UV-vis range (wider optical Eg), such an increase has negative effects in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum due to parasitic optical absorption by free carriers in the conduction band. This effect is called free carrier absorption (FCA), which is well described by the classical Drude theory.[55,56] The direct relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and Ne for the case of highly doped semiconductors is given by:[5,57] 4 2 3 e 2 0 3 e * 2 opt a e N c n m λ π ε µ ( ) = (2) where λ is the photon wavelength, n is the refractive index, and μopt the optical mobility. It is important to note here that the μopt might differ from the Hall mobility (μHall) since the former is not affected by macroscopic scattering effects as grain-boundaries or film dislocations. Therefore, in polycrystalline films, μopt is often referred as in-grain mobility.[56,58] Equation (2) indicates that FCA (AFCA = 1 –e−αd, with A the absorptance and d is the thickness of the film), will increase with Ne and d. To minimize FCA (a strict requirement for application in efficient solar cells), Ne should be reduced and μ maximized. The absorptance curves and their correlation with the electrical and microstructural properties of distinct TCOs are presented in Section 4 and Figure 2. A full derivation of Equation (2) is given in the Supporting Information. 3.1.2. P-type Transparent Conductors All high-performance TCOs used in commercial applications are n-type. Comparable transparent p-type conductors have yet to be developed. If made available, they could be used in a number of applications, including as electrodes that could offer carrier selectivity and enable carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, as interconnect layers (i.e., recombination junctions) in tandem photovoltaics and as electrodes for fully transparent electronics. There have been some reports of transparent p-type conductors in the literature but their conductivities and figures of merit remain orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TCOs (Figure 1). The difficulty in finding optimal p-type TCOs stems largely from the specific electronic structure of candidate wide-gap metal oxides, consisting of a highly localized oxygen 2p valence band with a large hole effective mass ( h * m > 1m0, compared with 0.2–0.3m0 for n-type) and thus a very low hole mobility, cf. Equation (1).[59] In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of most oxides is energetically situated deeply below the vacuum level, resulting in a high ionization potential. This impedes p-type doping, mainly due to compensation (i.e., “hole killing”) by intrinsic defect generation of the intentionally introduced p-dopants.[60] To improve the mobility by achieving high crystal purity (and minimal scattering), most p-type TCOs, like their n-type counterparts, require high synthesis temperatures that jeopardize their use in devices with sensitive thermal budgets. Fortunately, there are material design principles that can be employed to increase the mobility while maintaining wide optical band gaps in p-type metal oxides. The first such principle is to alloy a wide-gap metal oxide with Cu+1 to create CuxMyOz and then to hybridize the Cu+1 closed-shell 3d[10] electrons with O2p orbitals. This approach, which delocalizes the valence band and thus decreases h * m , was used to demonstrate the first p-TCO, delafossite CuAlO2, in 1997.[61] With a free carrier density of holes of Nh = 1.3 × 1017 cm−3 and a hole mobility at ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1, the conductivity (<1 S cm−1) was much lower than of n-type TCOs. Subsequently, other Cu-based delafossites with Al replaced by other metal cations, such as Cr,[62] Fe,[63] Sc,[64] and Y,[65] were investigated with oxygen intercalation and various synthesis methods (and thus, various microstructures) with the aim of decreasing the dopant compensation and increasing mobility (Figure 1). Recently, the CuCrO2 has been explored with promising results; Mg-doped CuCrO2 has the highest p-type conductivity reported for an oxide to date, 220 S cm−1. In related work cationic and anion substitution and the role of Cr vacancies in this material has been studied.[66,67] High conductivity has also been shown experimentally in non-Cu metal oxides, most notably spinel-structured TCOs, such as NiCo2O4,[68,69] perovskites-structured TCOs, such as SrInxTi1–xO3 and SrxLa1–xCrO3,[70,71] and amorphous or composite oxides, such as ZnO·Rh2O3 and In:MoO3.[72,73] Other oxides, such as doped Cr2O3 and Ba2BiTaO6, have promise but remain to be synthesized with high conductivities.[74,75] A second, more recently employed approach is to look beyond oxides. Interestingly, one of the first transparent conductors, discovered by Karl Baedeker in 1907, was a nonoxide, p-type degenerate semiconductor, CuI.[76,77] Non-oxide wide-gap (direct and indirect) semiconductors with P, S, or N anions are attractive candidates for p-type materials discovery as their valence bands are more delocalized, leading to a lower hole effective mass.[59,78] This approach has been demonstrated experimentally with Cu-based p-type transparent chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) and oxychalcogenides, most notably CuAlS2, BaCu2S2, BaCu2(S, Se)F, and Cu-Zn-S, resolving one of the issues with the localized O 2p orbital and, upon optimization, reaching conductivities greater than 10 S cm−1.[79–82] The Cu-Zn-S system (also notated CuyS:CuxZn1–xS) includes films grown at temperatures lower than 100°C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), achieving p-type conductivities approaching those of the n-type TCOs (Figure 1).[82] Additionally, Hosono and co-workers have www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (6 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT developed a new class of transparent layered oxychalcogenides LnOCuCh (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y; Ch: S, Se), with conductivities up to 140 S cm−1.[83,84] The transparent conducting materials discussed above present different challenges in terms of optimization and eventual device implementation. The majority of oxide-based p-type conductors discussed have low carrier concentrations (1017 to 1019 cm−3) and conduct via an activated transport or hopping mechanism. As a result, improving conductivity involves both increasing the electron density and the mobility. In the nonoxide chalcogenide-based systems, the band gap tends to be smaller compared to oxides. Additionally, the chalcogenidebased transparent p-type conductors are degenerately doped semiconductors with temperature-independent conductivity, limited by ionized impurity scattering. Compensation by deep donors can reduce both the hole concentration and the mobility, through the increase of ionized impurity scattering. This trade-off has been explored computationally for some specific oxide studies,[85,86] but a more general approach targeting non-oxides would be valuable. Phosphides and nitrides in general have lower hole effective masses, but are less transparent than oxides (phosphide band gaps are on the order of 2 eV). To circumvent this trade-off, a third design principle, proposed by Varley et al., among others,[78] is to explore systems with a low mh and a wide direct band gap. That is, materials with small indirect gaps could still be transparent in the visible so long as their direct gap is larger than 3.1 eV. Their study targeted and screened phosphides, suggesting further exploration of BP and AlP, among others. This approach was recently supported experimentally with pellets of CaCuP (with weak absorption at 2.2 eV and stronger absorption at 2.7 eV), showing conductivities up to 500 S cm−1, although thin films of this material have yet to be synthesized.[87] Figure 1 compares the conductivity of various high-performing transparent n-type and p-type conductors as a function of the synthesis temperature. It can be noted that at high values of conductivity the non-oxides tend to be more strongly absorbing due to their lower band gaps. Finally, as noted earlier, while n-type TCOs can reach high conductivity even in their amorphous state, p-type TCOs exhibit much lower conductivity at high synthesis temperatures. 3.2. Metal Nanowires, Nano- and Microgrids, and Ultrathin Films The use of metal nanowires (NWs) as transparent electrodes is based on the high metallic conductivity of the wires. The nanoto-micrometer-scale diameters of these wires allow the formation of microscale network grids that are sufficiently sparse to avoid dramatic shadow losses in the transparency. As a consequence, the conductivity of such transparent electrodes does not depend on intrinsic materials properties, as is the case for TCOs, but rather on the network density, quality of the nanowires and optimum welding of the network interconnects. In detail, a high density of NWs limits transmittance by increased reflection in the visible. A high aspect ratio (long, small diameter) with good crystalline quality (defect-free to avoid electron scattering and no nanoparticle formation within the wire to avoid plasmonic absorption) and a highly pure metal lead to high-quality nanowires, and passage of electrical current without contact barriers comes from optimum welding of the network interconnects.[88] Silver (Ag) is the most commonly used metal for transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity. Cu and Zn, as well as carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, have also been widely proposed.[8,89] Usually, these networks can be deposited gently on underlying structures, which can be an advantage for processing-sensitive devices, such as organic[90] and perovskite solar cells.[91] Challenges common to all NW network approaches are their poor chemical stability and tendency to oxidize, their large surface roughness, their weak adhesion to the substrate and high contact resistance to adjacent functional layers in devices. To overcome some of these challenges, NWs can be embedded in transparent dielectrics, conductive polymers,[92] graphene oxide,[93] and metal oxides.[94] Stability data on NW electrodes are not widely reported, but recent efforts indicate possibilities to improve the performance of transparent NW electrodes. The properties of Ag NWs, CNTs, and several other nanostructures for applications as transparent electrodes, optimization approaches and performance have been extensively reviewed in ref. [8,89,95] In relation to metallic networks, it is important to mention other recently proposed approaches. One consists of the formation of transparent conductive grid patterns by self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles deposited by ink-jet printing.[96] Another approach, closer to the standard one using macroscopic metal www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

KGaA, Weinheim (7 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT grids, consists of 3D designs for the metal lines. These designs could redirect the light into the device avoiding shadow losses and forming “effectively transparent contacts”.[97] Ultrathin metal films have also been proposed as transparent conductors. Although these metal films have excellent electrical properties for thicknesses of only a few tens of nanometers, reflectance losses reduce the amount of light that couples effectively in devices, and the absence of a bandgap limits the transparency of the electrodes. Placing these metal films between two transparent, high-refractive-index layers reduces the reflectance of the metal, leading to gains in transmittance in the visible spectrum.[20] The optical absorptance and electrical properties of this type of electrodes are discussed in Section 4. 3.3. Graphene and Other 2D Materials Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely proposed as transparent electrodes, due to their atomic monolayer thicknesses (allowing high optical transmittance) and the possibility of ballistic transport, i.e., non-scattering of electrons even at room temperature. Of these materials, graphene is arguably the leading 2D material, which, despite its lack of a bandgap, was also quickly proposed as a potential transparent conductor.[98,99] A monolayer of graphene can have carrier mobilities above 10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1.[33] So far, such carrier mobility was achievable only in nanometer-scale, free-standing graphene flakes, obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and on films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on boron nitride substrates.[100] When transferring to substrates or upscaling the fabrication of graphene films, defects are introduced, thereby lowering the carrier mobility. Batch-to-batch production of high-quality graphene on large-area substrates, as well as the availability of transfer methods to obtain defect-free, highquality graphene, remain major obstacles in the application of graphene to commercial optoelectronic devices.[101] Moreover, despite its high mobility potential, the conductivity of graphene is low compared with more conventional transparent electrodes, largely because of its intrinsically low free carrier concentration (<1013 cm−3).[98] This may be resolved by impurity doping,[102] intercalation doping[103] and multilayer film growth,[33] all approaches that have resulted in device-relevant Rsh values. A clear advantage of graphene electrodes, like for metal NWs, is their tolerance to bending and stretching.[104] Therefore, for applications in which flexibility and stretchability are the most important requirements and a high Rsh is acceptable (e.g., foldable capacitive touch screens, see Table 1), graphene could be a good material candidate. In addition to graphene, other emerging 2D materials such as phosphorene[105] and stanene (a single layer of Sn, yet to be experimentally realized) have been proposed as promising optoelectronic materials because of their potential to be as transparent and flexible as graphene.[106] Further exploration in this field could lead to 2D-layered materials with the performance required for use as transparent electrodes in flexible, deformable, or even skin-like optoelectronic devices. Table 2 summarizes the above-described transparent electrodes, the property that allows both, conductivity and transmittance, the materials and methods used for fabrication, as well as their general position in the market. 4. Classification of Transparent Electrodes According to the Requirements for Solar Cells and OLEDs The two most important requirements of a high-performance transparent electrode are low optical absorptance and high lateral conductivity (low Rsh). When comparing transparent electrodes, we should remember that optical properties are dependent on wavelength. It is precisely this dependency of the optical properties on wavelength that largely dictates which transparent electrode is best suited to a specific application. Materials that feature low absorptance in the wavelength range at which the active part of the device absorbs or emits light most efficiently should be explored. In this section, we classify various transparent electrodes according to their Rsh and optical absorptance using the following methodology: a) The optical absorptance of different electrodes is compared instead of the transmittance. The reason for this is that the often-used optical transmittance is strongly linked to the reflectance of the transparent electrode, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the optical properties of the substrate, the film thickness, and the surface texture. In addition, while the transmittance is normally measured on a flat glass substrate, several solar cell absorbers feature textured surfaces (e.g., silicon heterojunction solar cells[1]) or randomly oriented grains (e.g., CIGS and CZTS[107]), which increase the roughness of the films and influence the reflectance of the layered stacks. To make an accurate and fair comparison of the amount of light that is parasitically absorbed by a transparent electrode, independent of the substrate and surface roughness, we therefore use the absorptance (A) value, defined as A = 1 – TT – TR, where TT is the total transmittance and TR is the total reflectance. b) The spectrally weighted absorptance (Aweighted,x, where x is the solar cell or OLED) of the electrodes is compared rather than the absorptance at a single wavelength. The spectrally weighted absorptance takes into account the relevant wavelength range and the intensity of the light source that is absorbed or emitted by the device. This is expressed by d d weighted, light, light, 1, 2, 1 2 A I A I x x x x x ∫ ∫ λ λ λ λ ( ) ( ) = λ λ λ λ (3) where A(λ) is the absorptance of the transparent electrode as a function of wavelength, Ilight,x is the intensity of the light source spectrum, and λ1,x and λ2,x are the wavelength’s range as defined by the application. In solar cells, Ilight,solar is the 1 sun air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum. The wavelength range (λ1 to λ2) depends on the type of solar cell. Here, we use the wavelength range from λ1 = 320 to λ2 = 1200 nm (Figure 2a), which covers the range of most of the solar cells analyzed here. In OLEDs, Ilight,OLED is the emission spectrum of a white OLED in the wavelength range from λ1 = 380 to λ2 = 780 nm (Figure 3a).

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (8 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT sensitivity spectrum (Figure 3b) should also be taken into account. c) To compare different transparent electrodes, we use the following figure of merit (FOM): FOM 1 weighted, sh A R x = (4) As a result, high-quality transparent electrodes are characterized by high FOM values. d) Finally, with the exception of graphene, we compare transparent electrodes only for which transmittance and reflectance data have been reported. 4.1. Transparent Electrodes as Front Contacts in Solar Cells Figure 2 shows the standardized terrestrial solar irradiance spectrum (AM1.5) under 1 sun intensity (a) and the external quantum efficiencies (QE) (left axis, b) for a range of archetypical high-efficiency solar cells that employ transparent electrodes, namely perovskite, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and perovskite-SHJ tandem solar cells. The absorptance curves of various transparent electrodes are presented in Figure 2b (right axis). Figure 2b shows that the front transparent electrode in any solar cell should have a sufficiently large (>3 eV) optical band gap to avoid absorption losses in the visible range of the spectrum. This requirement is already fulfilled by several TCOs.[23] For example, the optical band gap (Eg) of sputtered ITO, IZO and IO:H films are between 3.5 and 3.8 eV.[111] Transparent electrodes with low absorptance in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum (transparent electrodes with low FCA) are required for CIGS, SHJ and multi-junction devices, such as perovskite-onsilicon[109,112] and perovskite-on-CIGS[113] tandem solar cells, as these devices employ optical absorbers that are active in this range of the spectrum. These tandem approaches are new highefficiency photovoltaic technologies, with a potential to reach about 30% efficiency,[114,115] clearly underscoring the critical importance and urgency of designing transparent electrodes with exceptionally large broadband transparency. By comparing the absorptance curves of the TCOs in Figure 2b, we observe that hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H)[116] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 2. a) AM1.5G 1 sun irradiance spectra and b) quantum efficiency of a perovskite,[108] CdTe,[95] CIGS,[95] perovskite-SHJ tandem,[109] and SHJ[110] solar cells as a function of wavelength.

All the compared TCOs were deposited by sputtering deposition, with the exception of ZnO:B and FTO, which were deposited by CVD, and AZOCBD, which was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD). All transparent electrodes were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C to match the thermal budget of the solar cells. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (9 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT and cerium/hydrogen or tungsten/hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H, IWO:H, respectively)[117] offer the best optical properties, with an absorptance below 2% from 400 up to 1200 nm. Another notable TCO with minimal absorptance in the NIR-IR range is doped CdO[52] (not shown here). These TCOs have an excellent optical-electrical trade-off, potentially from their exceptionally high electron mobilities, on the order of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, combined with their relatively low free carrier densities. More specifically, in the case of IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H, the free carrier densities are usually below 3 × 1020 cm−3. Their electron mobilities are about 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IO:H and IWO:H and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ICO:H, resulting in Rsh in the range of 30–40 Ω sq−1 (Figure 2c), which are excellent values for high-efficiency solar cell applications. The high free electron mobilities in these polycrystalline hydrogenated In2O3-based materials are explained by the formation of large grains, together with possible grain-boundary passivation by hydrogen, as well as the fact that H atoms in the film do not contribute significantly to ionized or neutral impurity scattering.[118,119] IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H have been successfully applied in SHJ,[117,120–122] CIGS,[123] and perovskite solar cells.[124] Amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) is another TCO with low FCA and good electrical properties. Even with an amorphous structure (different from polycrystalline IO:H and ICO:H), IZO can have electron mobilities up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for free carrier densities between 1–3 × 1020 cm−3.[111,125,126] An attractive feature of these TCOs is that they already have excellent optoelectronic properties in their as-deposited state; these properties are not much affected by post-deposition annealing and offer opportunities for temperature-sensitive applications. A possible drawback is their relatively high absorption in the UV-vis range due to optical band gap narrowing.[111] This is a common effect in amorphous materials caused by exponential subgap tails due to disorder (also called Urbach tails)[127,128] and the presence of defects that introduce subgap absorption centers.[129] The application of IZO in solar cells has been demonstrated in SHJ[111] and perovskite solar cells.[130] A particularly attractive feature of all indium-oxide-based electrodes (including ITO) is the fact that their refractive index is close to 2.

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (10 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT ideal thickness is dictated by quarter wave-length conditions, corresponding to about 75 nm for the AM1.5G spectrum, ensuring a reflection minimum at 600 nm. Boron-doped ZnO (BZO) has attractive properties for certain photovoltaic devices as well.[131–133] A BZO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1 essentially shows the same low NIR-IR absorptance as IO:H (30 Ω sq−1), even though much thicker BZO films are required to obtain such results. Regardless of the thickness, BZO maintains its excellent optical properties for two reasons: low free carrier densities (in the order of 1019 cm−3) and a particular increase of electron mobility with increasing film thickness (due to its pyramidal shaped grains).[134,135] Electron mobilities up to 58 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in BZO films post-treated with H2 plasma.[136] The red curve in Figure 2b shows the absorptance of a BZO electrode with 10 Ω sq−1 Rsh. This very low Rsh is achieved by increasing the thickness of the film by 1 to 5 µm. Given the required thickness to obtain sufficiently conductive films, BZO films are not used as antireflective coatings. However, due to their self-texturing tendency during CVD, they offer excellent light-trapping conditions for thin-film photovoltaics, as evidenced by their successful application in thin-film silicon[137,138] and CIGS solar cells.[139] The absorptances of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) with 30 Ω sq−1111 and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with 15 Ω sq−1140 are already much higher than those of IO:H, IWO:H, ICO:H, IZO, and BZO. The high parasitic absorption in the NIR range of these materials originates from their high free carrier densities, required because their electron mobilities are lower than 40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Current losses linked to parasitic absorption in the front ITO in SHJ cells or in the front FTO in perovskiteSHJ tandem cells have been analyzed in ref. [140] and ref. [141], respectively. The popularity of both TCOs for application as window layers in solar cells is partly due to their chemical and environmental stability, as well as their demonstrated largescale production.[142,143] It is important to note that while IO:H and ICO:H are excellent electrodes for photovoltaic cells, they are still relatively new materials and their fabrication at production-relevant scales is yet to be demonstrated. One of the challenges for upscaling hydrogenated indium oxides is to control the introduction of water molecules during deposition (to include the H dopants). Approaches such as the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) would be, for example, a controlled way to grow high mobility IO:H.[118] With the obvious efforts to replace ITO with high-mobility TCOs, we expect the development of industry-relevant techniques for their fabrication. Aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes have also been widely used in PV devices.[144–146] AZO, like BZO, is attractive due to its non-toxicity and the abundance of Zn in the Earth’s crust. The low FOM value compared to, e.g., BZO, is due to the higher FCA in AZO. AZO is polycrystalline, with a columnar-like structure, forming grain boundaries that limit its mobility (typically on the order of 10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1). Postthermal treatments are known to improve the resistivity of AZO by increasing its free carrier density.[147] The electron mobility of sputtered AZO has been successfully increased up to 40–67 cm2 V−1 s−1 by incorporating a capping layer and applying a high-temperature (650°C) annealing step.[148] Considering the temperature restriction of several devices, low Rsh values are therefore mainly achieved by increasing Ne, at the cost of an inflated FCA. Although the FOM values for sputtered and chemical-bath-deposited (CBD) AZO are similar, deposition from solution presents some advantages: it is a simple and low-cost process,[149] and it is gentle, preventing physical damage to the substrates or active device layers where the material is deposited. Next to CBD, ALD and CVD are gentle deposition techniques as well and used for fabrication of several of the transparent electrodes discussed here. The ITO/Ag/AZO layer stack suffers the highest absorptance, from 500 to 800 nm, of all the curves compared. This is related to large reflectance and absorption losses in the thin metal film that provides the very low Rsh values. The shown absorptance is from[150]; however, approaches to improve the optical properties, e.g., by oxidizing the intermediate Ag film, have been demonstrated in subsequent reports.[151] While these films are not optimal for high efficiency solar cells, the possibility of sputtering these layers at room temperature, the limited total thickness of the trilayer-stack (<100 nm) and the ductility of the intermediate metal layer, with a thickness between 8 and 12 nm, make these electrodes interesting for flexible optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the high reflectance of these layers has been used to create a resonant optical cavity to trap the light in organic solar cells and, as a consequence, to increase their quantum efficiencies.[152] A summary of the approaches to optimize these types of dielectric/metal/dielectric layers for application in organic photovoltaic devices is found in ref. [153]. Finally, the absorptance curve of a monolayer of graphene, as reported in ref. [41], indicates that the use of such a material can be beneficial for applications in the NIR-IR range. However, in the visible range, the absorptance is already much higher than several of the other shown transparent electrodes. This is also reflected by the fact that a realistic Rsh value of 1000 Ω sq−1154 results in the lowest solar-cell FOM of all transparent electrodes, as shown in Figure 2d, casting doubt on whether monolayer graphene will ever find applications in highly efficient solar cells. As noted earlier, doping approaches and multilayers of graphene reduce the Rsh to more device-relevant values, but this is at the expense of increased absorptance.[41] Figure 2c shows normalized weighted absorptance as a function of Rsh for the various transparent electrodes compared here. Dashed lines of constant FOM are given for reference. These dashed lines highlight the observation that FOM converges for cases of very large Rsh values with very low absorptance or vice versa. Therefore, in Figure 2c we restricted the comparison of FOM values for transparent electrodes to a maximum of Rsh = 100 Ω sq−1, which is a relevant value for applications in photovoltaic devices. Figure 2d compares the FOM of transparent electrodes classified by thickness. The electrodes are sorted from left to right with the thickest electrodes, poorly suited for flexible applications on the left, and thinner electrodes, which present higher resistance to mechanical bending and stretching, on the right.[18] Note that Figure 2 considers a very general case by using only the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum under a 1 Sun intensity to evaluate transparent electrodes for any solar cell. To calculate the FOM for a specific solar cell, Equation (3) can be modified to include the quantum efficiency of the device: www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

Transparent Electrodes as Front Electrodes in OLEDs To evaluate FOM of transparent electrodes geared towards applications in OLEDs (a similar case would apply for bottomemitting LEDs), we use a white OLED spectrum simulated with SETFOS.[155] Figure 3 shows the white OLED spectrum used as Ilight (λ) in Equation (4) to evaluate the weighted absorptance of transparent electrodes. Contrary to solar cells, applications in LEDs, or OLEDs for lighting, displays or touch screens feature a narrower wavelength range at which the transparent electrode should have minimum absorptance, relaxing the optical requirements as compared with solar cells. In fact, effects such as the Burstein-Moss shift or FCA in TCOs have only a minimal influence on the parasitic absorption for these applications. Nevertheless, we can observe in Figure 3b that the absorptance of the TCOs still follows a similar trend as in Figure 2b,c, with ZnO:B, ICO:H, and IWO:H the transparent electrodes with the lowest absorptance and highest conductivity, and therefore exhibiting the highest FOMs. In this comparison, we have also included the case of a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) combined with metal grids embedded on a polymer matrix.[156] ZTO is an amorphous TCO, with sufficient conductivity to be utilized in combination with metal grids as the anode in large-area flexible OLEDs. In fact, it was demonstrated that with the same type of metal grids, ZTO devices performed better than the reference ITO OLEDs.[157] As observed in Figure 3c, the combination of the exceptionally low absorptance and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1 for ZnO:B, or even a lower Rsh (1 Ω sq−1) provided by the metal grids in the case of the hybrid ZTO + metal grid electrode, gives the highest FOM to these two transparent electrodes. The large thickness of ZnO:B, required to achieve low Rsh values, may prevent its application in flexible devices, however, as indicated in Figure 3d. For such applications, hybrid electrodes based on ZTO and metal grids may offer a better alternative.[156] However, in rigid top-emitting LEDs, ZnO:B, when grown by LPCVD, has the additional advantage of an intrinsic pyramidal surface texture with known light scattering properties,[137] improving light out coupling.[158] TCO/metal/TCO stacks and Ag NWs are on par in our FOM comparison. Although neither features simultaneously optimal Rsh and absorptance, these transparent electrodes offer properties that are interesting for flexible devices. For our comparison, we use representative absorptance and Rsh data of Ag NWs taken from the current literature.[8,95,159,160] However, we note that intensive research efforts are ongoing on Ag NWs, promising further performance improvements. Such improvements will mainly be achieved by increased fabrication control and deposition of metal grids with submicron-width lines,[161] development of hybrid approaches to improve stability under corrosive and oxidation conditions, as well as improved adhesion to the substrates. A monolayer of graphene with a sheet resistivity of 1000 Ω sq−1 gives, by far, the lowest FOM for photovoltaics. We note that for the case of OLEDs, the FOM is reaching a comparable value relative to other transparent electrodes in the list. This is because the absorptance values of the various transparent electrodes are comparably low in the relevant wavelength range for these devices (the visible light spectrum). Nevertheless, the 1000 Ω sq−1 Rsh associated with a monolayer of graphene raises the concern of high resistive losses when applied in devices. Hybrid approaches offer help in such cases. As an example, several laboratory-scale OLEDs and LEDs have used graphene-based electrodes, i.e., hybrid nanowires and graphene, conductive polymer and graphene and graphene oxide layers.[35,162] However, only a few groups have demonstrated the use of a single layer of graphene as the anode in small-area OLED devices.[163] 5. Other Specific Requirements of Transparent Electrodes for Solar Cells and OLEDs 5.1. Fabrication Compatibility As listed in Table 1, fabrication compatibility, i.e., processing temperature, chemical inertness, and non-damaging methods, is also an important selection criterion for transparent electrodes to be used in specific devices. For example, the thermal budget of OLEDs, SHJ, CIGS, CdTe, and perovskite-based solar cells is below 200 °C.[164,165] Clearly, fabrication of transparent electrodes on plastic flexible substrates also requires strict fabrication temperatures below approximately 150 °C. In this context, all electrodes depicted in Figure 2 and 3 were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C, during both deposition and post-deposition annealing (when applicable). The only exception is FTO, which is normally deposited or post-treated at temperatures well above 200 °C.[166–168] Amorphous TCOs such as IZO, offer the greatest flexibility, as they can be deposited nominally at room temperature and do not require post-deposition annealing. Such TCOs have demonstrated their value in SHJ and perovskite solar cell fabrication.[111,130] As mentioned earlier, gentle deposition on underlying layers can also be a critical factor in electrode choice and raises questions about the use of well-established physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition for certain applications. Sputter damage, caused by UV radiation and particle bombardment, is a known phenomenon in organic,[16] SHJ,[15] and perovskite[169] solar cells as well as flexible displays. Solutions to overcome such damage include the use of remote plasma sources,[170] the use of gently deposited buffer layers[171] or further improvements to solution-based deposition processes to improve the density and purity of TCO films to achieve high electron mobilities at low temperatures.[45,172] 5.2. Interfaces with the Transparent Electrodes Good electrical and chemical matching at the interface between transparent electrodes and their adjacent layers in a device is another criterion for electrode selection and optimization. This interface can be shared with the carrier-collection or carrier-injection layers, but also with the metal grid of the device. www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (12 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT Large-area optoelectronic devices often require a metal grid, which is normally deposited on the transparent electrode, to minimize the lateral resistance and, thus, voltage loss over large areas. As an example, we present a sketch of a cross section of a SHJ solar cell in Figure 4 to highlight the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/TCO/metal interfaces with the corresponding band diagram. Transversely, minimizing electrical losses is equally important. Again, in SHJ solar cells, the main contributors to such transverse resistance are the contact resistances (ρc) at the metal/TCO interface (label 1 in Figure 4b) and, even more so, at the TCO/a-Si:H interface (label 3 in Figure 4b); the intrinsic resistance of the TCO in the transverse direction (label 2 in Figure 4b) is usually sufficiently low to be neglected. Across the metal/TCO interface, the dominant carrier transport mechanism is field emission, for which the contact resistivity (ρc) is expressed as exp with E = 4 field emission c B * 0 E qh N m e ρ φ π ε ε ( ) ∝     ∞ (6) where φB is the barrier height and E is the tunneling energy.[174] This equation makes evident the improvement in ρc from the increased carrier density, Ne, of the transparent electrode, which suggests the use of bilayer TCOs that feature high surface but low bulk Ne to minimize ρc and FCA simultaneously.[121] Practically, the TCO/metal contact resistance is commonly characterized by the transfer length method (TLM).[175] In terms of metallization, screen-printed, low-temperature Ag pastes are commonly used, especially in industry. In such a case, ρc values on the order of 10−5 Ω cm[2] are typical, as is the case of the ITO/Ag and a-IZO/Ag interfaces, commonly used in solar cells.[111,176] Electroplated Cu can offer advantages in terms of line resistivity and material cost compared with printed Ag electrodes. However, due to the ease of diffusing electroplated Cu into silicon, where it can act as a carrier lifetime killer, its application to photovoltaics is not evident. Interestingly, ITO forms an excellent Cu diffusion barrier. The low measuredρc value for the Cu/ITO interface (ρc < 10−4 cm−3) validates this combination for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.[176] Contrary to the case of TCOs, achievement of sufficiently low ρc between the metal and Ag NWs or graphene electrodes is still an unresolved challenge.[100] To extract or inject carriers efficiently in solar cells or OLEDs, respectively, the interface between the transparent electrode and the active layer of the device (absorber or emitter) should have a negligible contact resistance (ρc) as well.[177] A main cause of this resistance is the combined effect of Fermi-level pinning at the interface and work function mismatch between adjacent materials.[177] This causes the formation of an interfacial energy barrier, characterized by a certain height and depletion width penetrating both materials. Such barriers can in principle be overcome by thermionic (field) emission, evidenced by lowered ρc values with increasing operating temperatures.[178] The barrier width can also be narrowed by increasing surface doping to increase field emission across the interface, similar to the metal/TCO case. As an alternative to doping, the work function of TCOs can be modified by surface treatments (UV, ozone, oxygen plasma),[179] or by the application of specific interfacial buffer layers with optimized work functions. The work function and band alignment of various TCOs for selected devices have been studied by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).[11,12,180] A selected list of TCOs and metals with their respective work function values as reported in literature is found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). In metal NWs and graphene electrodes, the work function cannot be intrinsically modified; however, a common approach is the application of a capping layer or creating hybrid electrodes with high or low work function polymers[177] or metal oxide films.[181,182] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 4. a) Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell structure and b) zoom-in of the front TCO layer indicating the 1. metal/TCO interface, 2. bulk and 3.

In either case, collected carriers need to overcome in principle several barriers, namely at the c-Si/a-Si:H, the a-Si:H/TCO, and the TCO/metal interface (not drawn). The first barrier is caused by band offsets. The second one can be caused by Fermi-level pinning at the interface and insufficient doping of a-Si:H and TCO. Because the TCO is normally n-type, an Ohmic contact for electrons is in principle guaranteed on the rear side. Transport at the TCO(n)/a-Si:H(p) interface occurs by band-to-band tunneling with photogenerated holes efficiently recombining with electrons from the TCO.[173] © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (13 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT 5.3. Stability Under Thermal and Humid Environments Environmental stability of transparent electrodes is also of critical importance when integrating them in devices. Damp heat tests performed under standard conditions of 85% humidity at 85°C for prolonged time (1000 h) were used to demonstrate the high environmental stability of ITO and IZO electrodes.[183] IO:H and AZO, on the contrary, showed poorer electrical stability under damp heat conditions mainly due to the introduction of water at grain boundaries.[183,184] In the case of IO:H it has been recently demonstrated that damp heat degradation is strongly linked to the hydrogen content in the films. IO:H films with hydrogen content lower than 5 at.% exhibit stable electrical properties after exposure to DH conditions.[185] The application of capping layers, e.g., capping IO:H with a very thin and dense layer of ITO, improves the environmental stability of the electrodes.[183] In terms of thermal stability, full-device fabrication might require temperature steps that could modify the carrier density or microstructure in TCOs, degrading the optoelectronic properties. TCOs with good temperature stability are mainly multicompound amorphous materials, such as IZO and ZTO.[125,186] In nanowire networks, clustering of the network due to a temperature step would increase the roughness of the electrode and induce the formation of shorts in e.g. organic devices. In addition to temperature, UV exposure may also detrimentally affect some transparent electrodes. Conductive polymers used in organic devices and hybrid electrodes, such as nanowire-based and metal grids embedded in a conductive polymer, yellow with exposure to UV and temperature.[187] In terms of chemical stability, cleaning of the substrate before OLED or perovskite cell deposition can cause damage to the transparent electrodes. SnO2, ITO, and a-ZnSnO are among the TCOs with the highest chemical stabilities[146] and therefore are fully compatible with industry-based processes to fabricate, e.g., OLED devices.[157] 6. Perspectives The continuous drive to increase solar cell efficiency, as well as the push for improved performance of several other optoelectronic devices, requires the development of transparent electrodes with next-generation requirements, including ultrahigh broadband transparency, high conductivity, adaptability, and composition mainly from abundant elements. The best example of a device that requires premium broadband transparent electrodes on its front is the perovskite-silicon multi-junction solar cell, which, as indicated in Figure 2, aims at active absorption of the broadest photon-energy range. The electrodes in this type of solar cell need to feature a wide band gap, low FCA, and relatively low sheet resistivity. In addition, they should be deposited without damaging the carrier-selective contacts in the silicon cell, or the perovskite layers, and cannot be annealed. The best solution for this is a very high mobility TCO, deposited at room-temperature using a gentle deposition technique. Amorphous indium-based TCOs are the best candidates; however, widening of their band gap remains a challenge. Further exploration of materials to find the right dopants or compounds that open up the band gap or of new material systems with tuned compositions and microstructures is just one path to the discovery of amorphous low-temperature and gently-deposited high mobility broadband transparent electrodes. In terms of deposition, further development of high-end deposition techniques, such as ALD, low-temperature solution-based deposition processes, or new PVD system designs that avoid the direct exposure of the substrate to the plasma during deposition (e.g., high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation,[188,189] or facing target sputtering[190]), is just one path to the development of ultra-high performance TCOs and TCOs/ device interfaces. Material design is also expected to play a decisive role in the development of Earth-abundant transparent electrodes, as well as for the discovery of high-performance transparent and conductive materials especially with p-type conductivity. Much is expected from high-throughput screenings using the combination of computational and experimental methods, looking for new design principles and experimenting with various synthesis approaches. On the p-type TCO side, recent investigations of metal-based oxysulfides or non-oxide chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) or pnictides (N, P) as potential p-type transparent conducting candidates show promise in reducing the hole effective mass and to increase conductivity. Recent progress on sulfide-based p-type transparent conductors has enabled device demonstrations that employ p-type transparent contacts. For example, low-temperature synthesized Cu-Zn-S has been applied as a hole-selective contact in solar cells with n-type absorbers.[81] The scalability and low processing temperature of these p-type transparent conductors merits further material and device exploration. Aside from transparency and conductivity, other specific properties (stretchability, self-healing, antibacterial properties) of transparent electrodes are becoming increasingly important as they are being implemented into thin, lightweight and wearable devices that require both ease-of-use and robustness. Examples of these are fiber-like electrodes,[191,192] consisting of fully integrated conductive fibers with a transparent matrix or skin-integrated circuits and optoelectronics that require transparent electrodes fabricated with non-toxic and biocompatible materials. The combination of optoelectronic and environmental or mechanical requirements is in many cases best achieved by hybrid approaches that integrate polymers and high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Lastly, in addition to the three different approaches to create transparent electrodes presented earlier in the manuscript, a largely unexplored area is the use of photonic crystals and metamaterials. In this case, light management through structures with metallic conductivity could simultaneously provide transparency and charge transport, creating transparent conductive structures.

Ager, and Christophe Ballif* DOI: 10.1002/aelm.201600529 1. Introduction The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented entrance in both variety and volume of optoelectronic devices into the consumer-electronics market. With this growth, there has also been a transition to devices that offer attractive features such as semi-transparency, flexibility, stretchability, tactility, and energy With the development of new generations of optoelectronic devices that combine high performance and novel functionalities (e.g., flexibility/bendability, adaptability, semi or full transparency), several classes of transparent electrodes have been developed in recent years. These range from optimized transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), which are historically the most commonly used transparent electrodes, to new electrodes made from nano- and 2D materials (e.g., metal nanowire networks and graphene), and to hybrid electrodes that integrate TCOs or dielectrics with nanowires, metal grids, or ultrathin metal films. Here, the most relevant transparent electrodes developed to date are introduced, their fundamental properties are described, and their materials are classified according to specific application requirements in high efficiency solar cells and flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This information serves as a guideline for selecting and developing appropriate transparent electrodes according to intended application requirements and functionality. Dr. M. Morales-Masis, Prof. C.

Woods-Robinson Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720, USA efficiency. Most such devices with these attractive features require transparent electrodes that enable these functionalities. Sustainable fabrication of transparent electrodes with readily available raw materials and their recyclability are also important criteria for successful commercialization. This article reviews the status of the development of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic devices. In the first section, we list the relevant properties that these electrodes require for their intended applications, including transparency and conductivity. We also describe other factors that affect device operation or contribute to device efficiency. As an example, highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells can generate short-circuit current densities higher than 40 mA cm−2 that must be laterally transported to the metal contacts of the cells.[1] Such large photogenerated current densities require transparent electrodes that can carry the current densities over large surface areas without excessive power dissipation. The electrodes in some light-emitting diodes (LEDs) must also transport similarly large current densities. In the second part of this report, we describe the distinct material systems that simultaneously enable transparency and conductivity and that are available either at the laboratory or the commercial scale. In the third section, we classify transparent electrodes according to their applicability to various types of highly efficient solar cells and to organic and inorganic LEDs (OLEDs, LEDs). To this classification, we add the processing compatibility requirements for actual device fabrication and electrode integration. Because reviews on each class of transparent electrodes are available (e.g., on metal oxide electrodes for displays and thin-film transistors,[2,3] on properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs);[4–7] and on general properties of graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanostructures[8]), the last section presents transparent electrodes by mostly focusing on the technological development, applications, and our perspective on future developments of inorganic electrodes. 2. Application Requirements of Transparent Electrodes in Optoelectronic Devices Typical optoelectronic devices that require transparent electrodes include touchscreens, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), smart windows, most types of solar cells (e.g., thin-film silicon, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and silicon-wafer-based www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (2 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT heterojunction solar cells), OLEDs, and LEDs. In general terms, the electrodes in solar cells should simultaneously guarantee unhindered current flow out of a large device area and efficient light coupling into the active area of the cell.[9] Displays and OLEDs have very similar requirements for their electrodes: current flow in and light coupling out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that all optoelectronic devices have identical requirements in terms of optical transmittance-lateral conductivity properties.[10] However, optimal performance from each type of device can be achieved only by specific optimization of its electrodes, such as minimized contact resistance with the adjacent active layer of the device (e.g., by work function matching),[11–13] low-damage deposition processing,[14–16] conformal film deposition, stretchability and bendability,[17–19] or temperature stability. In this context, we present the main requirements for transparent electrodes in each type of device in Table 1. We note that lateral conductivity is evaluated as sheet resistance (Rsh = 1/σd, where σ is the electrical conductivity of the material and d is the thickness of the electrode). As a device-relevant parameter, Rsh is used for comparison of the transparent electrodes discussed in Section 4 rather than conductivity, which is an intrinsic material property. Because of the broadness of this topic, we hereafter narrow our focus to transparent electrodes for high efficiency solar cells, LEDs and OLEDs. 3. Material Systems for Transparent Electrodes Only a few material systems simultaneously offer optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In fact, there is always a trade-off between these properties, which fortunately can often be tuned for specific applications. The first and most traditional strategy for developing a transparent conductor is to find a material that intrinsically offers both characteristics, i.e., a wide band-gap material with n- or p-type conduction. Classic examples of n-type doped transparent conductors are Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), F-doped SnO2 (FTO), doped zinc oxide (ZnO), and cadmium oxide (CdO).[4,22–25] Conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) also partially offer both intrinsic properties.[26–28] A second strategy consists of dimensional engineering using conductive, but not necessarily transparent materials (e.g., metals or carbon-based materials[29]) and their arrangement in such a way that the system conducts in one direction and is transparent in the other. This is achieved by arranging the conductive material in either a very thin layer or a mesh of (nano-)wires.[8,30–32] The use of 2D materials can be considered as a third approach, with graphene as the most prominent material.[33–35] The latter material offers in theory inplane (ballistic) conductance, while being quite transparent due to their limited thickness. Also available are hybrid approaches that combine the properties of several material systems into a single functional electrode,[36–39] such as embedded metal nanowire networks in a dielectric matrix. Below, we consider three approaches that build on inorganic transparent electrodes developed in recent years, their fundamental properties, their fabrication processes, and their position in the market either as raw materials or utilized in commercial devices. To classify the electrodes based on its technology maturity we used the concept Monica Morales-Masis is team leader for transparent electrodes development at the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory (PVLab) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

The TRL are given in a range from 1 to 9, with 1 being the lowest level of technology readiness (at the scientific study stage, observation of basic principles) and 9 the highest level (when a technology reaches commercialization). As commented above, Table 2 focuses on inorganic materials, extensive reviews of the conductive polymer approach have previously been published.[26,28,40] 3.1. Transparent Conductors 3.1.1. N-Type Transparent Conductors Highly doped (degenerate) metal oxides, commonly known as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), are the most widely used and studied transparent electrodes to date. Conventional TCO materials are tin-, zinc-, cadmium- and indium-based oxides (SnO2, ZnO, CdO, In2O3). Other reported materials with TCO properties include titanium oxide (TiO2) and calcium aluminate (12CaO⋅7Al2O3).[42,43] Conventional TCOs are binary systems, mainly polycrystalline in nature and doped with halides, group XIII, or XV elements,[6] almost always forming n-type semiconductors. Recently, multi-compound oxides (e.g., IGZO, ZTO, IZO),[44] aiming at improved mechanical properties and thermal stability due to their amorphous nature, have also been widely studied and have electrical properties that are often on par with their polycrystalline counterparts.[44,45] The simultaneous ability of binary and multi-compound metal oxides to offer high optical transmittance in a broad photon-energy range and high electrical conductivity is attributed to their specific electronic structure. Conventional TCOs are mainly formed by metal atoms with the (n – 1)d10ns[2] electronic configuration.[44,46] Interaction of the metal s states (Ms) and oxygen p states (Op) results in the formation of a wide band gap (Eg > 3 eV), allowing the transmittance of photons in the visible range and below.[47] The valence band (VB) is composed of occupied oxygen 2p states, whereas the conduction band (CB) is formed by an overlapping Ms-Op-Ms network. This Ms-Op-Ms network results in a highly dispersed band (observed as a large curvature at the conduction band edge, see figure in Table 2, column 2, row 2) which leads to a low effective electron mass ( e * m ) in the range of 0.2–0.3m0, where m0 is the resting mass of the electron.[48] The electron mobility (μ) in dispersed bands in the relaxation time approximation depends on e * m and the average time between two scattering events (or carrier relaxation time) (τ), according to the following expression: e * e m µ τ = (1) τ is influenced by all possible scattering mechanisms relevant to electron transport in the films: grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials,[49] microstructural defects such as voids or stacking faults, point defects such as neutral or ionized impurities and lattice vibrations (i.e., phonon scattering). To increase the free electron mobility in TCOs, a low e * m , low free-carrier density and low-defective material are thus required. Typical TCO electron mobilities range from 10 up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.[3] The electron mobilities of polycrystalline and amorphous TCOs can be very similar. This similarity is generally attributed to the spherical symmetry of the Ms orbitals, which has a marginal effect on the angular variations in the Ms-Op-Msnetwork; this network forms the conduction band. The Ms-OpMs overlap (the cation-oxide orbital hybridization) plays a key www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Table 1.

The properties that allow simultaneous transmittance and conductivity, i.e., wide band gap and degeneration conduction in n-type TCOs (first two rows in column 2), metallic conduction by percolation through sparse nanowire networks (first two rows in column 3), and ballistic transport in the specific case of a monolayer of graphene, allowing transparency because of its 1-atom thickness (row 2, column 4).[41] The materials and deposition techniques used to fabricate these transparent electrodes are listed along with their market readiness and estimated technology readiness level (TRL). © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (5 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT turn gives rise to a large dispersion of the conduction band and therefore a small e * m . Various types of indium-oxide-based TCOs also exhibit high electron mobilities, as discussed further in Section 4. The electrical conductivity (σ) is proportional to μ and the free-carrier density (Ne) as σ = eμNe. Ne can be increased in TCOs by doping; typically used extrinsic dopants are halides, group XIII and XV elements. Intrinsic dopants can also be used, with oxygen vacancies the primary example.[6] Intrinsically, the Fermi level (EF) lies in most known TCOs close to the conduction band facilitating extrinsic n-type doping. Such doping shifts EF inside the conduction band, forming a degenerate n-type semiconductor, which also leads to further widening of the optical band gap (Eg) following the Burstein–Moss relation: ΔEg≈ Ne2/3.[5,53,54] Free-carrier densities of TCOs range from 1017 up to 1021 cm−3 (for comparison, metals have Ne on the order of 1022 cm−3). Although increasing Ne can be beneficial to the optical transmittance in the UV-vis range (wider optical Eg), such an increase has negative effects in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum due to parasitic optical absorption by free carriers in the conduction band. This effect is called free carrier absorption (FCA), which is well described by the classical Drude theory.[55,56] The direct relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and Ne for the case of highly doped semiconductors is given by:[5,57] 4 2 3 e 2 0 3 e * 2 opt a e N c n m λ π ε µ ( ) = (2) where λ is the photon wavelength, n is the refractive index, and μopt the optical mobility. It is important to note here that the μopt might differ from the Hall mobility (μHall) since the former is not affected by macroscopic scattering effects as grain-boundaries or film dislocations. Therefore, in polycrystalline films, μopt is often referred as in-grain mobility.[56,58] Equation (2) indicates that FCA (AFCA = 1 –e−αd, with A the absorptance and d is the thickness of the film), will increase with Ne and d. To minimize FCA (a strict requirement for application in efficient solar cells), Ne should be reduced and μ maximized. The absorptance curves and their correlation with the electrical and microstructural properties of distinct TCOs are presented in Section 4 and Figure 2. A full derivation of Equation (2) is given in the Supporting Information. 3.1.2. P-type Transparent Conductors All high-performance TCOs used in commercial applications are n-type. Comparable transparent p-type conductors have yet to be developed. If made available, they could be used in a number of applications, including as electrodes that could offer carrier selectivity and enable carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, as interconnect layers (i.e., recombination junctions) in tandem photovoltaics and as electrodes for fully transparent electronics. There have been some reports of transparent p-type conductors in the literature but their conductivities and figures of merit remain orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TCOs (Figure 1). The difficulty in finding optimal p-type TCOs stems largely from the specific electronic structure of candidate wide-gap metal oxides, consisting of a highly localized oxygen 2p valence band with a large hole effective mass ( h * m > 1m0, compared with 0.2–0.3m0 for n-type) and thus a very low hole mobility, cf. Equation (1).[59] In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of most oxides is energetically situated deeply below the vacuum level, resulting in a high ionization potential. This impedes p-type doping, mainly due to compensation (i.e., “hole killing”) by intrinsic defect generation of the intentionally introduced p-dopants.[60] To improve the mobility by achieving high crystal purity (and minimal scattering), most p-type TCOs, like their n-type counterparts, require high synthesis temperatures that jeopardize their use in devices with sensitive thermal budgets. Fortunately, there are material design principles that can be employed to increase the mobility while maintaining wide optical band gaps in p-type metal oxides. The first such principle is to alloy a wide-gap metal oxide with Cu+1 to create CuxMyOz and then to hybridize the Cu+1 closed-shell 3d[10] electrons with O2p orbitals. This approach, which delocalizes the valence band and thus decreases h * m , was used to demonstrate the first p-TCO, delafossite CuAlO2, in 1997.[61] With a free carrier density of holes of Nh = 1.3 × 1017 cm−3 and a hole mobility at ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1, the conductivity (<1 S cm−1) was much lower than of n-type TCOs. Subsequently, other Cu-based delafossites with Al replaced by other metal cations, such as Cr,[62] Fe,[63] Sc,[64] and Y,[65] were investigated with oxygen intercalation and various synthesis methods (and thus, various microstructures) with the aim of decreasing the dopant compensation and increasing mobility (Figure 1). Recently, the CuCrO2 has been explored with promising results; Mg-doped CuCrO2 has the highest p-type conductivity reported for an oxide to date, 220 S cm−1. In related work cationic and anion substitution and the role of Cr vacancies in this material has been studied.[66,67] High conductivity has also been shown experimentally in non-Cu metal oxides, most notably spinel-structured TCOs, such as NiCo2O4,[68,69] perovskites-structured TCOs, such as SrInxTi1–xO3 and SrxLa1–xCrO3,[70,71] and amorphous or composite oxides, such as ZnO·Rh2O3 and In:MoO3.[72,73] Other oxides, such as doped Cr2O3 and Ba2BiTaO6, have promise but remain to be synthesized with high conductivities.[74,75] A second, more recently employed approach is to look beyond oxides. Interestingly, one of the first transparent conductors, discovered by Karl Baedeker in 1907, was a nonoxide, p-type degenerate semiconductor, CuI.[76,77] Non-oxide wide-gap (direct and indirect) semiconductors with P, S, or N anions are attractive candidates for p-type materials discovery as their valence bands are more delocalized, leading to a lower hole effective mass.[59,78] This approach has been demonstrated experimentally with Cu-based p-type transparent chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) and oxychalcogenides, most notably CuAlS2, BaCu2S2, BaCu2(S, Se)F, and Cu-Zn-S, resolving one of the issues with the localized O 2p orbital and, upon optimization, reaching conductivities greater than 10 S cm−1.[79–82] The Cu-Zn-S system (also notated CuyS:CuxZn1–xS) includes films grown at temperatures lower than 100°C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), achieving p-type conductivities approaching those of the n-type TCOs (Figure 1).[82] Additionally, Hosono and co-workers have www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (6 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT developed a new class of transparent layered oxychalcogenides LnOCuCh (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y; Ch: S, Se), with conductivities up to 140 S cm−1.[83,84] The transparent conducting materials discussed above present different challenges in terms of optimization and eventual device implementation. The majority of oxide-based p-type conductors discussed have low carrier concentrations (1017 to 1019 cm−3) and conduct via an activated transport or hopping mechanism. As a result, improving conductivity involves both increasing the electron density and the mobility. In the nonoxide chalcogenide-based systems, the band gap tends to be smaller compared to oxides. Additionally, the chalcogenidebased transparent p-type conductors are degenerately doped semiconductors with temperature-independent conductivity, limited by ionized impurity scattering. Compensation by deep donors can reduce both the hole concentration and the mobility, through the increase of ionized impurity scattering. This trade-off has been explored computationally for some specific oxide studies,[85,86] but a more general approach targeting non-oxides would be valuable. Phosphides and nitrides in general have lower hole effective masses, but are less transparent than oxides (phosphide band gaps are on the order of 2 eV). To circumvent this trade-off, a third design principle, proposed by Varley et al., among others,[78] is to explore systems with a low mh and a wide direct band gap. That is, materials with small indirect gaps could still be transparent in the visible so long as their direct gap is larger than 3.1 eV. Their study targeted and screened phosphides, suggesting further exploration of BP and AlP, among others. This approach was recently supported experimentally with pellets of CaCuP (with weak absorption at 2.2 eV and stronger absorption at 2.7 eV), showing conductivities up to 500 S cm−1, although thin films of this material have yet to be synthesized.[87] Figure 1 compares the conductivity of various high-performing transparent n-type and p-type conductors as a function of the synthesis temperature. It can be noted that at high values of conductivity the non-oxides tend to be more strongly absorbing due to their lower band gaps. Finally, as noted earlier, while n-type TCOs can reach high conductivity even in their amorphous state, p-type TCOs exhibit much lower conductivity at high synthesis temperatures. 3.2. Metal Nanowires, Nano- and Microgrids, and Ultrathin Films The use of metal nanowires (NWs) as transparent electrodes is based on the high metallic conductivity of the wires. The nanoto-micrometer-scale diameters of these wires allow the formation of microscale network grids that are sufficiently sparse to avoid dramatic shadow losses in the transparency. As a consequence, the conductivity of such transparent electrodes does not depend on intrinsic materials properties, as is the case for TCOs, but rather on the network density, quality of the nanowires and optimum welding of the network interconnects. In detail, a high density of NWs limits transmittance by increased reflection in the visible. A high aspect ratio (long, small diameter) with good crystalline quality (defect-free to avoid electron scattering and no nanoparticle formation within the wire to avoid plasmonic absorption) and a highly pure metal lead to high-quality nanowires, and passage of electrical current without contact barriers comes from optimum welding of the network interconnects.[88] Silver (Ag) is the most commonly used metal for transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity. Cu and Zn, as well as carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, have also been widely proposed.[8,89] Usually, these networks can be deposited gently on underlying structures, which can be an advantage for processing-sensitive devices, such as organic[90] and perovskite solar cells.[91] Challenges common to all NW network approaches are their poor chemical stability and tendency to oxidize, their large surface roughness, their weak adhesion to the substrate and high contact resistance to adjacent functional layers in devices. To overcome some of these challenges, NWs can be embedded in transparent dielectrics, conductive polymers,[92] graphene oxide,[93] and metal oxides.[94] Stability data on NW electrodes are not widely reported, but recent efforts indicate possibilities to improve the performance of transparent NW electrodes. The properties of Ag NWs, CNTs, and several other nanostructures for applications as transparent electrodes, optimization approaches and performance have been extensively reviewed in ref. [8,89,95] In relation to metallic networks, it is important to mention other recently proposed approaches. One consists of the formation of transparent conductive grid patterns by self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles deposited by ink-jet printing.[96] Another approach, closer to the standard one using macroscopic metal www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

KGaA, Weinheim (7 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT grids, consists of 3D designs for the metal lines. These designs could redirect the light into the device avoiding shadow losses and forming “effectively transparent contacts”.[97] Ultrathin metal films have also been proposed as transparent conductors. Although these metal films have excellent electrical properties for thicknesses of only a few tens of nanometers, reflectance losses reduce the amount of light that couples effectively in devices, and the absence of a bandgap limits the transparency of the electrodes. Placing these metal films between two transparent, high-refractive-index layers reduces the reflectance of the metal, leading to gains in transmittance in the visible spectrum.[20] The optical absorptance and electrical properties of this type of electrodes are discussed in Section 4. 3.3. Graphene and Other 2D Materials Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely proposed as transparent electrodes, due to their atomic monolayer thicknesses (allowing high optical transmittance) and the possibility of ballistic transport, i.e., non-scattering of electrons even at room temperature. Of these materials, graphene is arguably the leading 2D material, which, despite its lack of a bandgap, was also quickly proposed as a potential transparent conductor.[98,99] A monolayer of graphene can have carrier mobilities above 10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1.[33] So far, such carrier mobility was achievable only in nanometer-scale, free-standing graphene flakes, obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and on films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on boron nitride substrates.[100] When transferring to substrates or upscaling the fabrication of graphene films, defects are introduced, thereby lowering the carrier mobility. Batch-to-batch production of high-quality graphene on large-area substrates, as well as the availability of transfer methods to obtain defect-free, highquality graphene, remain major obstacles in the application of graphene to commercial optoelectronic devices.[101] Moreover, despite its high mobility potential, the conductivity of graphene is low compared with more conventional transparent electrodes, largely because of its intrinsically low free carrier concentration (<1013 cm−3).[98] This may be resolved by impurity doping,[102] intercalation doping[103] and multilayer film growth,[33] all approaches that have resulted in device-relevant Rsh values. A clear advantage of graphene electrodes, like for metal NWs, is their tolerance to bending and stretching.[104] Therefore, for applications in which flexibility and stretchability are the most important requirements and a high Rsh is acceptable (e.g., foldable capacitive touch screens, see Table 1), graphene could be a good material candidate. In addition to graphene, other emerging 2D materials such as phosphorene[105] and stanene (a single layer of Sn, yet to be experimentally realized) have been proposed as promising optoelectronic materials because of their potential to be as transparent and flexible as graphene.[106] Further exploration in this field could lead to 2D-layered materials with the performance required for use as transparent electrodes in flexible, deformable, or even skin-like optoelectronic devices. Table 2 summarizes the above-described transparent electrodes, the property that allows both, conductivity and transmittance, the materials and methods used for fabrication, as well as their general position in the market. 4. Classification of Transparent Electrodes According to the Requirements for Solar Cells and OLEDs The two most important requirements of a high-performance transparent electrode are low optical absorptance and high lateral conductivity (low Rsh). When comparing transparent electrodes, we should remember that optical properties are dependent on wavelength. It is precisely this dependency of the optical properties on wavelength that largely dictates which transparent electrode is best suited to a specific application. Materials that feature low absorptance in the wavelength range at which the active part of the device absorbs or emits light most efficiently should be explored. In this section, we classify various transparent electrodes according to their Rsh and optical absorptance using the following methodology: a) The optical absorptance of different electrodes is compared instead of the transmittance. The reason for this is that the often-used optical transmittance is strongly linked to the reflectance of the transparent electrode, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the optical properties of the substrate, the film thickness, and the surface texture. In addition, while the transmittance is normally measured on a flat glass substrate, several solar cell absorbers feature textured surfaces (e.g., silicon heterojunction solar cells[1]) or randomly oriented grains (e.g., CIGS and CZTS[107]), which increase the roughness of the films and influence the reflectance of the layered stacks. To make an accurate and fair comparison of the amount of light that is parasitically absorbed by a transparent electrode, independent of the substrate and surface roughness, we therefore use the absorptance (A) value, defined as A = 1 – TT – TR, where TT is the total transmittance and TR is the total reflectance. b) The spectrally weighted absorptance (Aweighted,x, where x is the solar cell or OLED) of the electrodes is compared rather than the absorptance at a single wavelength. The spectrally weighted absorptance takes into account the relevant wavelength range and the intensity of the light source that is absorbed or emitted by the device. This is expressed by d d weighted, light, light, 1, 2, 1 2 A I A I x x x x x ∫ ∫ λ λ λ λ ( ) ( ) = λ λ λ λ (3) where A(λ) is the absorptance of the transparent electrode as a function of wavelength, Ilight,x is the intensity of the light source spectrum, and λ1,x and λ2,x are the wavelength’s range as defined by the application. In solar cells, Ilight,solar is the 1 sun air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum. The wavelength range (λ1 to λ2) depends on the type of solar cell. Here, we use the wavelength range from λ1 = 320 to λ2 = 1200 nm (Figure 2a), which covers the range of most of the solar cells analyzed here. In OLEDs, Ilight,OLED is the emission spectrum of a white OLED in the wavelength range from λ1 = 380 to λ2 = 780 nm (Figure 3a).

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (8 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT sensitivity spectrum (Figure 3b) should also be taken into account. c) To compare different transparent electrodes, we use the following figure of merit (FOM): FOM 1 weighted, sh A R x = (4) As a result, high-quality transparent electrodes are characterized by high FOM values. d) Finally, with the exception of graphene, we compare transparent electrodes only for which transmittance and reflectance data have been reported. 4.1. Transparent Electrodes as Front Contacts in Solar Cells Figure 2 shows the standardized terrestrial solar irradiance spectrum (AM1.5) under 1 sun intensity (a) and the external quantum efficiencies (QE) (left axis, b) for a range of archetypical high-efficiency solar cells that employ transparent electrodes, namely perovskite, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and perovskite-SHJ tandem solar cells. The absorptance curves of various transparent electrodes are presented in Figure 2b (right axis). Figure 2b shows that the front transparent electrode in any solar cell should have a sufficiently large (>3 eV) optical band gap to avoid absorption losses in the visible range of the spectrum. This requirement is already fulfilled by several TCOs.[23] For example, the optical band gap (Eg) of sputtered ITO, IZO and IO:H films are between 3.5 and 3.8 eV.[111] Transparent electrodes with low absorptance in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum (transparent electrodes with low FCA) are required for CIGS, SHJ and multi-junction devices, such as perovskite-onsilicon[109,112] and perovskite-on-CIGS[113] tandem solar cells, as these devices employ optical absorbers that are active in this range of the spectrum. These tandem approaches are new highefficiency photovoltaic technologies, with a potential to reach about 30% efficiency,[114,115] clearly underscoring the critical importance and urgency of designing transparent electrodes with exceptionally large broadband transparency. By comparing the absorptance curves of the TCOs in Figure 2b, we observe that hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H)[116] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 2. a) AM1.5G 1 sun irradiance spectra and b) quantum efficiency of a perovskite,[108] CdTe,[95] CIGS,[95] perovskite-SHJ tandem,[109] and SHJ[110] solar cells as a function of wavelength.

All the compared TCOs were deposited by sputtering deposition, with the exception of ZnO:B and FTO, which were deposited by CVD, and AZOCBD, which was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD). All transparent electrodes were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C to match the thermal budget of the solar cells. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (9 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT and cerium/hydrogen or tungsten/hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H, IWO:H, respectively)[117] offer the best optical properties, with an absorptance below 2% from 400 up to 1200 nm. Another notable TCO with minimal absorptance in the NIR-IR range is doped CdO[52] (not shown here). These TCOs have an excellent optical-electrical trade-off, potentially from their exceptionally high electron mobilities, on the order of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, combined with their relatively low free carrier densities. More specifically, in the case of IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H, the free carrier densities are usually below 3 × 1020 cm−3. Their electron mobilities are about 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IO:H and IWO:H and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ICO:H, resulting in Rsh in the range of 30–40 Ω sq−1 (Figure 2c), which are excellent values for high-efficiency solar cell applications. The high free electron mobilities in these polycrystalline hydrogenated In2O3-based materials are explained by the formation of large grains, together with possible grain-boundary passivation by hydrogen, as well as the fact that H atoms in the film do not contribute significantly to ionized or neutral impurity scattering.[118,119] IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H have been successfully applied in SHJ,[117,120–122] CIGS,[123] and perovskite solar cells.[124] Amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) is another TCO with low FCA and good electrical properties. Even with an amorphous structure (different from polycrystalline IO:H and ICO:H), IZO can have electron mobilities up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for free carrier densities between 1–3 × 1020 cm−3.[111,125,126] An attractive feature of these TCOs is that they already have excellent optoelectronic properties in their as-deposited state; these properties are not much affected by post-deposition annealing and offer opportunities for temperature-sensitive applications. A possible drawback is their relatively high absorption in the UV-vis range due to optical band gap narrowing.[111] This is a common effect in amorphous materials caused by exponential subgap tails due to disorder (also called Urbach tails)[127,128] and the presence of defects that introduce subgap absorption centers.[129] The application of IZO in solar cells has been demonstrated in SHJ[111] and perovskite solar cells.[130] A particularly attractive feature of all indium-oxide-based electrodes (including ITO) is the fact that their refractive index is close to 2. This is approximately the geometric mean of the refractive indices of air and typical solar cell absorbers (such as silicon), which gives these materials very good anti-reflective coating (ARC) properties.

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (10 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT ideal thickness is dictated by quarter wave-length conditions, corresponding to about 75 nm for the AM1.5G spectrum, ensuring a reflection minimum at 600 nm. Boron-doped ZnO (BZO) has attractive properties for certain photovoltaic devices as well.[131–133] A BZO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1 essentially shows the same low NIR-IR absorptance as IO:H (30 Ω sq−1), even though much thicker BZO films are required to obtain such results. Regardless of the thickness, BZO maintains its excellent optical properties for two reasons: low free carrier densities (in the order of 1019 cm−3) and a particular increase of electron mobility with increasing film thickness (due to its pyramidal shaped grains).[134,135] Electron mobilities up to 58 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in BZO films post-treated with H2 plasma.[136] The red curve in Figure 2b shows the absorptance of a BZO electrode with 10 Ω sq−1 Rsh. This very low Rsh is achieved by increasing the thickness of the film by 1 to 5 µm. Given the required thickness to obtain sufficiently conductive films, BZO films are not used as antireflective coatings. However, due to their self-texturing tendency during CVD, they offer excellent light-trapping conditions for thin-film photovoltaics, as evidenced by their successful application in thin-film silicon[137,138] and CIGS solar cells.[139] The absorptances of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) with 30 Ω sq−1111 and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with 15 Ω sq−1140 are already much higher than those of IO:H, IWO:H, ICO:H, IZO, and BZO. The high parasitic absorption in the NIR range of these materials originates from their high free carrier densities, required because their electron mobilities are lower than 40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Current losses linked to parasitic absorption in the front ITO in SHJ cells or in the front FTO in perovskiteSHJ tandem cells have been analyzed in ref. [140] and ref. [141], respectively. The popularity of both TCOs for application as window layers in solar cells is partly due to their chemical and environmental stability, as well as their demonstrated largescale production.[142,143] It is important to note that while IO:H and ICO:H are excellent electrodes for photovoltaic cells, they are still relatively new materials and their fabrication at production-relevant scales is yet to be demonstrated. One of the challenges for upscaling hydrogenated indium oxides is to control the introduction of water molecules during deposition (to include the H dopants). Approaches such as the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) would be, for example, a controlled way to grow high mobility IO:H.[118] With the obvious efforts to replace ITO with high-mobility TCOs, we expect the development of industry-relevant techniques for their fabrication. Aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes have also been widely used in PV devices.[144–146] AZO, like BZO, is attractive due to its non-toxicity and the abundance of Zn in the Earth’s crust. The low FOM value compared to, e.g., BZO, is due to the higher FCA in AZO. AZO is polycrystalline, with a columnar-like structure, forming grain boundaries that limit its mobility (typically on the order of 10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1). Postthermal treatments are known to improve the resistivity of AZO by increasing its free carrier density.[147] The electron mobility of sputtered AZO has been successfully increased up to 40–67 cm2 V−1 s−1 by incorporating a capping layer and applying a high-temperature (650°C) annealing step.[148] Considering the temperature restriction of several devices, low Rsh values are therefore mainly achieved by increasing Ne, at the cost of an inflated FCA. Although the FOM values for sputtered and chemical-bath-deposited (CBD) AZO are similar, deposition from solution presents some advantages: it is a simple and low-cost process,[149] and it is gentle, preventing physical damage to the substrates or active device layers where the material is deposited. Next to CBD, ALD and CVD are gentle deposition techniques as well and used for fabrication of several of the transparent electrodes discussed here. The ITO/Ag/AZO layer stack suffers the highest absorptance, from 500 to 800 nm, of all the curves compared. This is related to large reflectance and absorption losses in the thin metal film that provides the very low Rsh values. The shown absorptance is from[150]; however, approaches to improve the optical properties, e.g., by oxidizing the intermediate Ag film, have been demonstrated in subsequent reports.[151] While these films are not optimal for high efficiency solar cells, the possibility of sputtering these layers at room temperature, the limited total thickness of the trilayer-stack (<100 nm) and the ductility of the intermediate metal layer, with a thickness between 8 and 12 nm, make these electrodes interesting for flexible optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the high reflectance of these layers has been used to create a resonant optical cavity to trap the light in organic solar cells and, as a consequence, to increase their quantum efficiencies.[152] A summary of the approaches to optimize these types of dielectric/metal/dielectric layers for application in organic photovoltaic devices is found in ref. [153]. Finally, the absorptance curve of a monolayer of graphene, as reported in ref. [41], indicates that the use of such a material can be beneficial for applications in the NIR-IR range. However, in the visible range, the absorptance is already much higher than several of the other shown transparent electrodes. This is also reflected by the fact that a realistic Rsh value of 1000 Ω sq−1154 results in the lowest solar-cell FOM of all transparent electrodes, as shown in Figure 2d, casting doubt on whether monolayer graphene will ever find applications in highly efficient solar cells. As noted earlier, doping approaches and multilayers of graphene reduce the Rsh to more device-relevant values, but this is at the expense of increased absorptance.[41] Figure 2c shows normalized weighted absorptance as a function of Rsh for the various transparent electrodes compared here. Dashed lines of constant FOM are given for reference. These dashed lines highlight the observation that FOM converges for cases of very large Rsh values with very low absorptance or vice versa. Therefore, in Figure 2c we restricted the comparison of FOM values for transparent electrodes to a maximum of Rsh = 100 Ω sq−1, which is a relevant value for applications in photovoltaic devices. Figure 2d compares the FOM of transparent electrodes classified by thickness. The electrodes are sorted from left to right with the thickest electrodes, poorly suited for flexible applications on the left, and thinner electrodes, which present higher resistance to mechanical bending and stretching, on the right.[18] Note that Figure 2 considers a very general case by using only the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum under a 1 Sun intensity to evaluate transparent electrodes for any solar cell. To calculate the FOM for a specific solar cell, Equation (3) can be modified to include the quantum efficiency of the device: www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

Transparent Electrodes as Front Electrodes in OLEDs To evaluate FOM of transparent electrodes geared towards applications in OLEDs (a similar case would apply for bottomemitting LEDs), we use a white OLED spectrum simulated with SETFOS.[155] Figure 3 shows the white OLED spectrum used as Ilight (λ) in Equation (4) to evaluate the weighted absorptance of transparent electrodes. Contrary to solar cells, applications in LEDs, or OLEDs for lighting, displays or touch screens feature a narrower wavelength range at which the transparent electrode should have minimum absorptance, relaxing the optical requirements as compared with solar cells. In fact, effects such as the Burstein-Moss shift or FCA in TCOs have only a minimal influence on the parasitic absorption for these applications. Nevertheless, we can observe in Figure 3b that the absorptance of the TCOs still follows a similar trend as in Figure 2b,c, with ZnO:B, ICO:H, and IWO:H the transparent electrodes with the lowest absorptance and highest conductivity, and therefore exhibiting the highest FOMs. In this comparison, we have also included the case of a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) combined with metal grids embedded on a polymer matrix.[156] ZTO is an amorphous TCO, with sufficient conductivity to be utilized in combination with metal grids as the anode in large-area flexible OLEDs. In fact, it was demonstrated that with the same type of metal grids, ZTO devices performed better than the reference ITO OLEDs.[157] As observed in Figure 3c, the combination of the exceptionally low absorptance and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1 for ZnO:B, or even a lower Rsh (1 Ω sq−1) provided by the metal grids in the case of the hybrid ZTO + metal grid electrode, gives the highest FOM to these two transparent electrodes. The large thickness of ZnO:B, required to achieve low Rsh values, may prevent its application in flexible devices, however, as indicated in Figure 3d. For such applications, hybrid electrodes based on ZTO and metal grids may offer a better alternative.[156] However, in rigid top-emitting LEDs, ZnO:B, when grown by LPCVD, has the additional advantage of an intrinsic pyramidal surface texture with known light scattering properties,[137] improving light out coupling.[158] TCO/metal/TCO stacks and Ag NWs are on par in our FOM comparison. Although neither features simultaneously optimal Rsh and absorptance, these transparent electrodes offer properties that are interesting for flexible devices. For our comparison, we use representative absorptance and Rsh data of Ag NWs taken from the current literature.[8,95,159,160] However, we note that intensive research efforts are ongoing on Ag NWs, promising further performance improvements. Such improvements will mainly be achieved by increased fabrication control and deposition of metal grids with submicron-width lines,[161] development of hybrid approaches to improve stability under corrosive and oxidation conditions, as well as improved adhesion to the substrates. A monolayer of graphene with a sheet resistivity of 1000 Ω sq−1 gives, by far, the lowest FOM for photovoltaics. We note that for the case of OLEDs, the FOM is reaching a comparable value relative to other transparent electrodes in the list. This is because the absorptance values of the various transparent electrodes are comparably low in the relevant wavelength range for these devices (the visible light spectrum). Nevertheless, the 1000 Ω sq−1 Rsh associated with a monolayer of graphene raises the concern of high resistive losses when applied in devices. Hybrid approaches offer help in such cases. As an example, several laboratory-scale OLEDs and LEDs have used graphene-based electrodes, i.e., hybrid nanowires and graphene, conductive polymer and graphene and graphene oxide layers.[35,162] However, only a few groups have demonstrated the use of a single layer of graphene as the anode in small-area OLED devices.[163] 5. Other Specific Requirements of Transparent Electrodes for Solar Cells and OLEDs 5.1. Fabrication Compatibility As listed in Table 1, fabrication compatibility, i.e., processing temperature, chemical inertness, and non-damaging methods, is also an important selection criterion for transparent electrodes to be used in specific devices. For example, the thermal budget of OLEDs, SHJ, CIGS, CdTe, and perovskite-based solar cells is below 200 °C.[164,165] Clearly, fabrication of transparent electrodes on plastic flexible substrates also requires strict fabrication temperatures below approximately 150 °C. In this context, all electrodes depicted in Figure 2 and 3 were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C, during both deposition and post-deposition annealing (when applicable). The only exception is FTO, which is normally deposited or post-treated at temperatures well above 200 °C.[166–168] Amorphous TCOs such as IZO, offer the greatest flexibility, as they can be deposited nominally at room temperature and do not require post-deposition annealing. Such TCOs have demonstrated their value in SHJ and perovskite solar cell fabrication.[111,130] As mentioned earlier, gentle deposition on underlying layers can also be a critical factor in electrode choice and raises questions about the use of well-established physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition for certain applications. Sputter damage, caused by UV radiation and particle bombardment, is a known phenomenon in organic,[16] SHJ,[15] and perovskite[169] solar cells as well as flexible displays. Solutions to overcome such damage include the use of remote plasma sources,[170] the use of gently deposited buffer layers[171] or further improvements to solution-based deposition processes to improve the density and purity of TCO films to achieve high electron mobilities at low temperatures.[45,172] 5.2. Interfaces with the Transparent Electrodes Good electrical and chemical matching at the interface between transparent electrodes and their adjacent layers in a device is another criterion for electrode selection and optimization. This interface can be shared with the carrier-collection or carrier-injection layers, but also with the metal grid of the device. www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (12 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT Large-area optoelectronic devices often require a metal grid, which is normally deposited on the transparent electrode, to minimize the lateral resistance and, thus, voltage loss over large areas. As an example, we present a sketch of a cross section of a SHJ solar cell in Figure 4 to highlight the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/TCO/metal interfaces with the corresponding band diagram. Transversely, minimizing electrical losses is equally important. Again, in SHJ solar cells, the main contributors to such transverse resistance are the contact resistances (ρc) at the metal/TCO interface (label 1 in Figure 4b) and, even more so, at the TCO/a-Si:H interface (label 3 in Figure 4b); the intrinsic resistance of the TCO in the transverse direction (label 2 in Figure 4b) is usually sufficiently low to be neglected. Across the metal/TCO interface, the dominant carrier transport mechanism is field emission, for which the contact resistivity (ρc) is expressed as exp with E = 4 field emission c B * 0 E qh N m e ρ φ π ε ε ( ) ∝     ∞ (6) where φB is the barrier height and E is the tunneling energy.[174] This equation makes evident the improvement in ρc from the increased carrier density, Ne, of the transparent electrode, which suggests the use of bilayer TCOs that feature high surface but low bulk Ne to minimize ρc and FCA simultaneously.[121] Practically, the TCO/metal contact resistance is commonly characterized by the transfer length method (TLM).[175] In terms of metallization, screen-printed, low-temperature Ag pastes are commonly used, especially in industry. In such a case, ρc values on the order of 10−5 Ω cm[2] are typical, as is the case of the ITO/Ag and a-IZO/Ag interfaces, commonly used in solar cells.[111,176] Electroplated Cu can offer advantages in terms of line resistivity and material cost compared with printed Ag electrodes. However, due to the ease of diffusing electroplated Cu into silicon, where it can act as a carrier lifetime killer, its application to photovoltaics is not evident. Interestingly, ITO forms an excellent Cu diffusion barrier. The low measuredρc value for the Cu/ITO interface (ρc < 10−4 cm−3) validates this combination for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.[176] Contrary to the case of TCOs, achievement of sufficiently low ρc between the metal and Ag NWs or graphene electrodes is still an unresolved challenge.[100] To extract or inject carriers efficiently in solar cells or OLEDs, respectively, the interface between the transparent electrode and the active layer of the device (absorber or emitter) should have a negligible contact resistance (ρc) as well.[177] A main cause of this resistance is the combined effect of Fermi-level pinning at the interface and work function mismatch between adjacent materials.[177] This causes the formation of an interfacial energy barrier, characterized by a certain height and depletion width penetrating both materials. Such barriers can in principle be overcome by thermionic (field) emission, evidenced by lowered ρc values with increasing operating temperatures.[178] The barrier width can also be narrowed by increasing surface doping to increase field emission across the interface, similar to the metal/TCO case. As an alternative to doping, the work function of TCOs can be modified by surface treatments (UV, ozone, oxygen plasma),[179] or by the application of specific interfacial buffer layers with optimized work functions. The work function and band alignment of various TCOs for selected devices have been studied by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).[11,12,180] A selected list of TCOs and metals with their respective work function values as reported in literature is found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). In metal NWs and graphene electrodes, the work function cannot be intrinsically modified; however, a common approach is the application of a capping layer or creating hybrid electrodes with high or low work function polymers[177] or metal oxide films.[181,182] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 4. a) Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell structure and b) zoom-in of the front TCO layer indicating the 1. metal/TCO interface, 2. bulk and 3. TCO/a-Si:H(p) interface. c) Energy band diagram of a complete SHJ solar cell in equilibrium, showing the band structure between the c-Si/a-Si:H(p)/TCO at the front and c-Si/a-Si:H(n)/TCO at the back of the cell, acting as the hole and electron contact, respectively. In either case, collected carriers need to overcome in principle several barriers, namely at the c-Si/a-Si:H, the a-Si:H/TCO, and the TCO/metal interface (not drawn). The first barrier is caused by band offsets. The second one can be caused by Fermi-level pinning at the interface and insufficient doping of a-Si:H and TCO. Because the TCO is normally n-type, an Ohmic contact for electrons is in principle guaranteed on the rear side. Transport at the TCO(n)/a-Si:H(p) interface occurs by band-to-band tunneling with photogenerated holes efficiently recombining with electrons from the TCO.[173] © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (13 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT 5.3. Stability Under Thermal and Humid Environments Environmental stability of transparent electrodes is also of critical importance when integrating them in devices. Damp heat tests performed under standard conditions of 85% humidity at 85°C for prolonged time (1000 h) were used to demonstrate the high environmental stability of ITO and IZO electrodes.[183] IO:H and AZO, on the contrary, showed poorer electrical stability under damp heat conditions mainly due to the introduction of water at grain boundaries.[183,184] In the case of IO:H it has been recently demonstrated that damp heat degradation is strongly linked to the hydrogen content in the films. IO:H films with hydrogen content lower than 5 at.% exhibit stable electrical properties after exposure to DH conditions.[185] The application of capping layers, e.g., capping IO:H with a very thin and dense layer of ITO, improves the environmental stability of the electrodes.[183] In terms of thermal stability, full-device fabrication might require temperature steps that could modify the carrier density or microstructure in TCOs, degrading the optoelectronic properties. TCOs with good temperature stability are mainly multicompound amorphous materials, such as IZO and ZTO.[125,186] In nanowire networks, clustering of the network due to a temperature step would increase the roughness of the electrode and induce the formation of shorts in e.g. organic devices. In addition to temperature, UV exposure may also detrimentally affect some transparent electrodes. Conductive polymers used in organic devices and hybrid electrodes, such as nanowire-based and metal grids embedded in a conductive polymer, yellow with exposure to UV and temperature.[187] In terms of chemical stability, cleaning of the substrate before OLED or perovskite cell deposition can cause damage to the transparent electrodes. SnO2, ITO, and a-ZnSnO are among the TCOs with the highest chemical stabilities[146] and therefore are fully compatible with industry-based processes to fabricate, e.g., OLED devices.[157] 6. Perspectives The continuous drive to increase solar cell efficiency, as well as the push for improved performance of several other optoelectronic devices, requires the development of transparent electrodes with next-generation requirements, including ultrahigh broadband transparency, high conductivity, adaptability, and composition mainly from abundant elements. The best example of a device that requires premium broadband transparent electrodes on its front is the perovskite-silicon multi-junction solar cell, which, as indicated in Figure 2, aims at active absorption of the broadest photon-energy range. The electrodes in this type of solar cell need to feature a wide band gap, low FCA, and relatively low sheet resistivity. In addition, they should be deposited without damaging the carrier-selective contacts in the silicon cell, or the perovskite layers, and cannot be annealed. The best solution for this is a very high mobility TCO, deposited at room-temperature using a gentle deposition technique. Amorphous indium-based TCOs are the best candidates; however, widening of their band gap remains a challenge. Further exploration of materials to find the right dopants or compounds that open up the band gap or of new material systems with tuned compositions and microstructures is just one path to the discovery of amorphous low-temperature and gently-deposited high mobility broadband transparent electrodes. In terms of deposition, further development of high-end deposition techniques, such as ALD, low-temperature solution-based deposition processes, or new PVD system designs that avoid the direct exposure of the substrate to the plasma during deposition (e.g., high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation,[188,189] or facing target sputtering[190]), is just one path to the development of ultra-high performance TCOs and TCOs/ device interfaces. Material design is also expected to play a decisive role in the development of Earth-abundant transparent electrodes, as well as for the discovery of high-performance transparent and conductive materials especially with p-type conductivity. Much is expected from high-throughput screenings using the combination of computational and experimental methods, looking for new design principles and experimenting with various synthesis approaches. On the p-type TCO side, recent investigations of metal-based oxysulfides or non-oxide chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) or pnictides (N, P) as potential p-type transparent conducting candidates show promise in reducing the hole effective mass and to increase conductivity. Recent progress on sulfide-based p-type transparent conductors has enabled device demonstrations that employ p-type transparent contacts. For example, low-temperature synthesized Cu-Zn-S has been applied as a hole-selective contact in solar cells with n-type absorbers.[81] The scalability and low processing temperature of these p-type transparent conductors merits further material and device exploration. Aside from transparency and conductivity, other specific properties (stretchability, self-healing, antibacterial properties) of transparent electrodes are becoming increasingly important as they are being implemented into thin, lightweight and wearable devices that require both ease-of-use and robustness. Examples of these are fiber-like electrodes,[191,192] consisting of fully integrated conductive fibers with a transparent matrix or skin-integrated circuits and optoelectronics that require transparent electrodes fabricated with non-toxic and biocompatible materials. The combination of optoelectronic and environmental or mechanical requirements is in many cases best achieved by hybrid approaches that integrate polymers and high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Lastly, in addition to the three different approaches to create transparent electrodes presented earlier in the manuscript, a largely unexplored area is the use of photonic crystals and metamaterials. In this case, light management through structures with metallic conductivity could simultaneously provide transparency and charge transport, creating transparent conductive structures.

Ager, and Christophe Ballif* DOI: 10.1002/aelm.201600529 1. Introduction The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented entrance in both variety and volume of optoelectronic devices into the consumer-electronics market. With this growth, there has also been a transition to devices that offer attractive features such as semi-transparency, flexibility, stretchability, tactility, and energy With the development of new generations of optoelectronic devices that combine high performance and novel functionalities (e.g., flexibility/bendability, adaptability, semi or full transparency), several classes of transparent electrodes have been developed in recent years. These range from optimized transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), which are historically the most commonly used transparent electrodes, to new electrodes made from nano- and 2D materials (e.g., metal nanowire networks and graphene), and to hybrid electrodes that integrate TCOs or dielectrics with nanowires, metal grids, or ultrathin metal films. Here, the most relevant transparent electrodes developed to date are introduced, their fundamental properties are described, and their materials are classified according to specific application requirements in high efficiency solar cells and flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This information serves as a guideline for selecting and developing appropriate transparent electrodes according to intended application requirements and functionality. Dr. M. Morales-Masis, Prof. C.

Woods-Robinson Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720, USA efficiency. Most such devices with these attractive features require transparent electrodes that enable these functionalities. Sustainable fabrication of transparent electrodes with readily available raw materials and their recyclability are also important criteria for successful commercialization. This article reviews the status of the development of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic devices. In the first section, we list the relevant properties that these electrodes require for their intended applications, including transparency and conductivity. We also describe other factors that affect device operation or contribute to device efficiency. As an example, highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells can generate short-circuit current densities higher than 40 mA cm−2 that must be laterally transported to the metal contacts of the cells.[1] Such large photogenerated current densities require transparent electrodes that can carry the current densities over large surface areas without excessive power dissipation. The electrodes in some light-emitting diodes (LEDs) must also transport similarly large current densities. In the second part of this report, we describe the distinct material systems that simultaneously enable transparency and conductivity and that are available either at the laboratory or the commercial scale. In the third section, we classify transparent electrodes according to their applicability to various types of highly efficient solar cells and to organic and inorganic LEDs (OLEDs, LEDs). To this classification, we add the processing compatibility requirements for actual device fabrication and electrode integration. Because reviews on each class of transparent electrodes are available (e.g., on metal oxide electrodes for displays and thin-film transistors,[2,3] on properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs);[4–7] and on general properties of graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanostructures[8]), the last section presents transparent electrodes by mostly focusing on the technological development, applications, and our perspective on future developments of inorganic electrodes. 2. Application Requirements of Transparent Electrodes in Optoelectronic Devices Typical optoelectronic devices that require transparent electrodes include touchscreens, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), smart windows, most types of solar cells (e.g., thin-film silicon, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and silicon-wafer-based www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (2 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT heterojunction solar cells), OLEDs, and LEDs. In general terms, the electrodes in solar cells should simultaneously guarantee unhindered current flow out of a large device area and efficient light coupling into the active area of the cell.[9] Displays and OLEDs have very similar requirements for their electrodes: current flow in and light coupling out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that all optoelectronic devices have identical requirements in terms of optical transmittance-lateral conductivity properties.[10] However, optimal performance from each type of device can be achieved only by specific optimization of its electrodes, such as minimized contact resistance with the adjacent active layer of the device (e.g., by work function matching),[11–13] low-damage deposition processing,[14–16] conformal film deposition, stretchability and bendability,[17–19] or temperature stability. In this context, we present the main requirements for transparent electrodes in each type of device in Table 1. We note that lateral conductivity is evaluated as sheet resistance (Rsh = 1/σd, where σ is the electrical conductivity of the material and d is the thickness of the electrode). As a device-relevant parameter, Rsh is used for comparison of the transparent electrodes discussed in Section 4 rather than conductivity, which is an intrinsic material property. Because of the broadness of this topic, we hereafter narrow our focus to transparent electrodes for high efficiency solar cells, LEDs and OLEDs. 3. Material Systems for Transparent Electrodes Only a few material systems simultaneously offer optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In fact, there is always a trade-off between these properties, which fortunately can often be tuned for specific applications. The first and most traditional strategy for developing a transparent conductor is to find a material that intrinsically offers both characteristics, i.e., a wide band-gap material with n- or p-type conduction. Classic examples of n-type doped transparent conductors are Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), F-doped SnO2 (FTO), doped zinc oxide (ZnO), and cadmium oxide (CdO).[4,22–25] Conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) also partially offer both intrinsic properties.[26–28] A second strategy consists of dimensional engineering using conductive, but not necessarily transparent materials (e.g., metals or carbon-based materials[29]) and their arrangement in such a way that the system conducts in one direction and is transparent in the other. This is achieved by arranging the conductive material in either a very thin layer or a mesh of (nano-)wires.[8,30–32] The use of 2D materials can be considered as a third approach, with graphene as the most prominent material.[33–35] The latter material offers in theory inplane (ballistic) conductance, while being quite transparent due to their limited thickness. Also available are hybrid approaches that combine the properties of several material systems into a single functional electrode,[36–39] such as embedded metal nanowire networks in a dielectric matrix. Below, we consider three approaches that build on inorganic transparent electrodes developed in recent years, their fundamental properties, their fabrication processes, and their position in the market either as raw materials or utilized in commercial devices. To classify the electrodes based on its technology maturity we used the concept Monica Morales-Masis is team leader for transparent electrodes development at the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory (PVLab) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

The TRL are given in a range from 1 to 9, with 1 being the lowest level of technology readiness (at the scientific study stage, observation of basic principles) and 9 the highest level (when a technology reaches commercialization). As commented above, Table 2 focuses on inorganic materials, extensive reviews of the conductive polymer approach have previously been published.[26,28,40] 3.1. Transparent Conductors 3.1.1. N-Type Transparent Conductors Highly doped (degenerate) metal oxides, commonly known as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), are the most widely used and studied transparent electrodes to date. Conventional TCO materials are tin-, zinc-, cadmium- and indium-based oxides (SnO2, ZnO, CdO, In2O3). Other reported materials with TCO properties include titanium oxide (TiO2) and calcium aluminate (12CaO⋅7Al2O3).[42,43] Conventional TCOs are binary systems, mainly polycrystalline in nature and doped with halides, group XIII, or XV elements,[6] almost always forming n-type semiconductors. Recently, multi-compound oxides (e.g., IGZO, ZTO, IZO),[44] aiming at improved mechanical properties and thermal stability due to their amorphous nature, have also been widely studied and have electrical properties that are often on par with their polycrystalline counterparts.[44,45] The simultaneous ability of binary and multi-compound metal oxides to offer high optical transmittance in a broad photon-energy range and high electrical conductivity is attributed to their specific electronic structure. Conventional TCOs are mainly formed by metal atoms with the (n – 1)d10ns[2] electronic configuration.[44,46] Interaction of the metal s states (Ms) and oxygen p states (Op) results in the formation of a wide band gap (Eg > 3 eV), allowing the transmittance of photons in the visible range and below.[47] The valence band (VB) is composed of occupied oxygen 2p states, whereas the conduction band (CB) is formed by an overlapping Ms-Op-Ms network. This Ms-Op-Ms network results in a highly dispersed band (observed as a large curvature at the conduction band edge, see figure in Table 2, column 2, row 2) which leads to a low effective electron mass ( e * m ) in the range of 0.2–0.3m0, where m0 is the resting mass of the electron.[48] The electron mobility (μ) in dispersed bands in the relaxation time approximation depends on e * m and the average time between two scattering events (or carrier relaxation time) (τ), according to the following expression: e * e m µ τ = (1) τ is influenced by all possible scattering mechanisms relevant to electron transport in the films: grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials,[49] microstructural defects such as voids or stacking faults, point defects such as neutral or ionized impurities and lattice vibrations (i.e., phonon scattering). To increase the free electron mobility in TCOs, a low e * m , low free-carrier density and low-defective material are thus required. Typical TCO electron mobilities range from 10 up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.[3] The electron mobilities of polycrystalline and amorphous TCOs can be very similar. This similarity is generally attributed to the spherical symmetry of the Ms orbitals, which has a marginal effect on the angular variations in the Ms-Op-Msnetwork; this network forms the conduction band. The Ms-OpMs overlap (the cation-oxide orbital hybridization) plays a key www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Table 1.

Types of transparent conductive electrodes. The properties that allow simultaneous transmittance and conductivity, i.e., wide band gap and degeneration conduction in n-type TCOs (first two rows in column 2), metallic conduction by percolation through sparse nanowire networks (first two rows in column 3), and ballistic transport in the specific case of a monolayer of graphene, allowing transparency because of its 1-atom thickness (row 2, column 4).[41] The materials and deposition techniques used to fabricate these transparent electrodes are listed along with their market readiness and estimated technology readiness level (TRL). © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (5 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT turn gives rise to a large dispersion of the conduction band and therefore a small e * m . Various types of indium-oxide-based TCOs also exhibit high electron mobilities, as discussed further in Section 4. The electrical conductivity (σ) is proportional to μ and the free-carrier density (Ne) as σ = eμNe. Ne can be increased in TCOs by doping; typically used extrinsic dopants are halides, group XIII and XV elements. Intrinsic dopants can also be used, with oxygen vacancies the primary example.[6] Intrinsically, the Fermi level (EF) lies in most known TCOs close to the conduction band facilitating extrinsic n-type doping. Such doping shifts EF inside the conduction band, forming a degenerate n-type semiconductor, which also leads to further widening of the optical band gap (Eg) following the Burstein–Moss relation: ΔEg≈ Ne2/3.[5,53,54] Free-carrier densities of TCOs range from 1017 up to 1021 cm−3 (for comparison, metals have Ne on the order of 1022 cm−3). Although increasing Ne can be beneficial to the optical transmittance in the UV-vis range (wider optical Eg), such an increase has negative effects in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum due to parasitic optical absorption by free carriers in the conduction band. This effect is called free carrier absorption (FCA), which is well described by the classical Drude theory.[55,56] The direct relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and Ne for the case of highly doped semiconductors is given by:[5,57] 4 2 3 e 2 0 3 e * 2 opt a e N c n m λ π ε µ ( ) = (2) where λ is the photon wavelength, n is the refractive index, and μopt the optical mobility. It is important to note here that the μopt might differ from the Hall mobility (μHall) since the former is not affected by macroscopic scattering effects as grain-boundaries or film dislocations. Therefore, in polycrystalline films, μopt is often referred as in-grain mobility.[56,58] Equation (2) indicates that FCA (AFCA = 1 –e−αd, with A the absorptance and d is the thickness of the film), will increase with Ne and d. To minimize FCA (a strict requirement for application in efficient solar cells), Ne should be reduced and μ maximized. The absorptance curves and their correlation with the electrical and microstructural properties of distinct TCOs are presented in Section 4 and Figure 2. A full derivation of Equation (2) is given in the Supporting Information. 3.1.2. P-type Transparent Conductors All high-performance TCOs used in commercial applications are n-type. Comparable transparent p-type conductors have yet to be developed. If made available, they could be used in a number of applications, including as electrodes that could offer carrier selectivity and enable carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, as interconnect layers (i.e., recombination junctions) in tandem photovoltaics and as electrodes for fully transparent electronics. There have been some reports of transparent p-type conductors in the literature but their conductivities and figures of merit remain orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TCOs (Figure 1). The difficulty in finding optimal p-type TCOs stems largely from the specific electronic structure of candidate wide-gap metal oxides, consisting of a highly localized oxygen 2p valence band with a large hole effective mass ( h * m > 1m0, compared with 0.2–0.3m0 for n-type) and thus a very low hole mobility, cf. Equation (1).[59] In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of most oxides is energetically situated deeply below the vacuum level, resulting in a high ionization potential. This impedes p-type doping, mainly due to compensation (i.e., “hole killing”) by intrinsic defect generation of the intentionally introduced p-dopants.[60] To improve the mobility by achieving high crystal purity (and minimal scattering), most p-type TCOs, like their n-type counterparts, require high synthesis temperatures that jeopardize their use in devices with sensitive thermal budgets. Fortunately, there are material design principles that can be employed to increase the mobility while maintaining wide optical band gaps in p-type metal oxides. The first such principle is to alloy a wide-gap metal oxide with Cu+1 to create CuxMyOz and then to hybridize the Cu+1 closed-shell 3d[10] electrons with O2p orbitals. This approach, which delocalizes the valence band and thus decreases h * m , was used to demonstrate the first p-TCO, delafossite CuAlO2, in 1997.[61] With a free carrier density of holes of Nh = 1.3 × 1017 cm−3 and a hole mobility at ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1, the conductivity (<1 S cm−1) was much lower than of n-type TCOs. Subsequently, other Cu-based delafossites with Al replaced by other metal cations, such as Cr,[62] Fe,[63] Sc,[64] and Y,[65] were investigated with oxygen intercalation and various synthesis methods (and thus, various microstructures) with the aim of decreasing the dopant compensation and increasing mobility (Figure 1). Recently, the CuCrO2 has been explored with promising results; Mg-doped CuCrO2 has the highest p-type conductivity reported for an oxide to date, 220 S cm−1. In related work cationic and anion substitution and the role of Cr vacancies in this material has been studied.[66,67] High conductivity has also been shown experimentally in non-Cu metal oxides, most notably spinel-structured TCOs, such as NiCo2O4,[68,69] perovskites-structured TCOs, such as SrInxTi1–xO3 and SrxLa1–xCrO3,[70,71] and amorphous or composite oxides, such as ZnO·Rh2O3 and In:MoO3.[72,73] Other oxides, such as doped Cr2O3 and Ba2BiTaO6, have promise but remain to be synthesized with high conductivities.[74,75] A second, more recently employed approach is to look beyond oxides. Interestingly, one of the first transparent conductors, discovered by Karl Baedeker in 1907, was a nonoxide, p-type degenerate semiconductor, CuI.[76,77] Non-oxide wide-gap (direct and indirect) semiconductors with P, S, or N anions are attractive candidates for p-type materials discovery as their valence bands are more delocalized, leading to a lower hole effective mass.[59,78] This approach has been demonstrated experimentally with Cu-based p-type transparent chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) and oxychalcogenides, most notably CuAlS2, BaCu2S2, BaCu2(S, Se)F, and Cu-Zn-S, resolving one of the issues with the localized O 2p orbital and, upon optimization, reaching conductivities greater than 10 S cm−1.[79–82] The Cu-Zn-S system (also notated CuyS:CuxZn1–xS) includes films grown at temperatures lower than 100°C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), achieving p-type conductivities approaching those of the n-type TCOs (Figure 1).[82] Additionally, Hosono and co-workers have www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (6 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT developed a new class of transparent layered oxychalcogenides LnOCuCh (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y; Ch: S, Se), with conductivities up to 140 S cm−1.[83,84] The transparent conducting materials discussed above present different challenges in terms of optimization and eventual device implementation. The majority of oxide-based p-type conductors discussed have low carrier concentrations (1017 to 1019 cm−3) and conduct via an activated transport or hopping mechanism. As a result, improving conductivity involves both increasing the electron density and the mobility. In the nonoxide chalcogenide-based systems, the band gap tends to be smaller compared to oxides. Additionally, the chalcogenidebased transparent p-type conductors are degenerately doped semiconductors with temperature-independent conductivity, limited by ionized impurity scattering. Compensation by deep donors can reduce both the hole concentration and the mobility, through the increase of ionized impurity scattering. This trade-off has been explored computationally for some specific oxide studies,[85,86] but a more general approach targeting non-oxides would be valuable. Phosphides and nitrides in general have lower hole effective masses, but are less transparent than oxides (phosphide band gaps are on the order of 2 eV). To circumvent this trade-off, a third design principle, proposed by Varley et al., among others,[78] is to explore systems with a low mh and a wide direct band gap. That is, materials with small indirect gaps could still be transparent in the visible so long as their direct gap is larger than 3.1 eV. Their study targeted and screened phosphides, suggesting further exploration of BP and AlP, among others. This approach was recently supported experimentally with pellets of CaCuP (with weak absorption at 2.2 eV and stronger absorption at 2.7 eV), showing conductivities up to 500 S cm−1, although thin films of this material have yet to be synthesized.[87] Figure 1 compares the conductivity of various high-performing transparent n-type and p-type conductors as a function of the synthesis temperature. It can be noted that at high values of conductivity the non-oxides tend to be more strongly absorbing due to their lower band gaps. Finally, as noted earlier, while n-type TCOs can reach high conductivity even in their amorphous state, p-type TCOs exhibit much lower conductivity at high synthesis temperatures. 3.2. Metal Nanowires, Nano- and Microgrids, and Ultrathin Films The use of metal nanowires (NWs) as transparent electrodes is based on the high metallic conductivity of the wires. The nanoto-micrometer-scale diameters of these wires allow the formation of microscale network grids that are sufficiently sparse to avoid dramatic shadow losses in the transparency. As a consequence, the conductivity of such transparent electrodes does not depend on intrinsic materials properties, as is the case for TCOs, but rather on the network density, quality of the nanowires and optimum welding of the network interconnects. In detail, a high density of NWs limits transmittance by increased reflection in the visible. A high aspect ratio (long, small diameter) with good crystalline quality (defect-free to avoid electron scattering and no nanoparticle formation within the wire to avoid plasmonic absorption) and a highly pure metal lead to high-quality nanowires, and passage of electrical current without contact barriers comes from optimum welding of the network interconnects.[88] Silver (Ag) is the most commonly used metal for transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity. Cu and Zn, as well as carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, have also been widely proposed.[8,89] Usually, these networks can be deposited gently on underlying structures, which can be an advantage for processing-sensitive devices, such as organic[90] and perovskite solar cells.[91] Challenges common to all NW network approaches are their poor chemical stability and tendency to oxidize, their large surface roughness, their weak adhesion to the substrate and high contact resistance to adjacent functional layers in devices. To overcome some of these challenges, NWs can be embedded in transparent dielectrics, conductive polymers,[92] graphene oxide,[93] and metal oxides.[94] Stability data on NW electrodes are not widely reported, but recent efforts indicate possibilities to improve the performance of transparent NW electrodes. The properties of Ag NWs, CNTs, and several other nanostructures for applications as transparent electrodes, optimization approaches and performance have been extensively reviewed in ref. [8,89,95] In relation to metallic networks, it is important to mention other recently proposed approaches. One consists of the formation of transparent conductive grid patterns by self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles deposited by ink-jet printing.[96] Another approach, closer to the standard one using macroscopic metal www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

These designs could redirect the light into the device avoiding shadow losses and forming “effectively transparent contacts”.[97] Ultrathin metal films have also been proposed as transparent conductors. Although these metal films have excellent electrical properties for thicknesses of only a few tens of nanometers, reflectance losses reduce the amount of light that couples effectively in devices, and the absence of a bandgap limits the transparency of the electrodes. Placing these metal films between two transparent, high-refractive-index layers reduces the reflectance of the metal, leading to gains in transmittance in the visible spectrum.[20] The optical absorptance and electrical properties of this type of electrodes are discussed in Section 4. 3.3. Graphene and Other 2D Materials Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely proposed as transparent electrodes, due to their atomic monolayer thicknesses (allowing high optical transmittance) and the possibility of ballistic transport, i.e., non-scattering of electrons even at room temperature. Of these materials, graphene is arguably the leading 2D material, which, despite its lack of a bandgap, was also quickly proposed as a potential transparent conductor.[98,99] A monolayer of graphene can have carrier mobilities above 10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1.[33] So far, such carrier mobility was achievable only in nanometer-scale, free-standing graphene flakes, obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and on films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on boron nitride substrates.[100] When transferring to substrates or upscaling the fabrication of graphene films, defects are introduced, thereby lowering the carrier mobility. Batch-to-batch production of high-quality graphene on large-area substrates, as well as the availability of transfer methods to obtain defect-free, highquality graphene, remain major obstacles in the application of graphene to commercial optoelectronic devices.[101] Moreover, despite its high mobility potential, the conductivity of graphene is low compared with more conventional transparent electrodes, largely because of its intrinsically low free carrier concentration (<1013 cm−3).[98] This may be resolved by impurity doping,[102] intercalation doping[103] and multilayer film growth,[33] all approaches that have resulted in device-relevant Rsh values. A clear advantage of graphene electrodes, like for metal NWs, is their tolerance to bending and stretching.[104] Therefore, for applications in which flexibility and stretchability are the most important requirements and a high Rsh is acceptable (e.g., foldable capacitive touch screens, see Table 1), graphene could be a good material candidate. In addition to graphene, other emerging 2D materials such as phosphorene[105] and stanene (a single layer of Sn, yet to be experimentally realized) have been proposed as promising optoelectronic materials because of their potential to be as transparent and flexible as graphene.[106] Further exploration in this field could lead to 2D-layered materials with the performance required for use as transparent electrodes in flexible, deformable, or even skin-like optoelectronic devices. Table 2 summarizes the above-described transparent electrodes, the property that allows both, conductivity and transmittance, the materials and methods used for fabrication, as well as their general position in the market. 4. Classification of Transparent Electrodes According to the Requirements for Solar Cells and OLEDs The two most important requirements of a high-performance transparent electrode are low optical absorptance and high lateral conductivity (low Rsh). When comparing transparent electrodes, we should remember that optical properties are dependent on wavelength. It is precisely this dependency of the optical properties on wavelength that largely dictates which transparent electrode is best suited to a specific application. Materials that feature low absorptance in the wavelength range at which the active part of the device absorbs or emits light most efficiently should be explored. In this section, we classify various transparent electrodes according to their Rsh and optical absorptance using the following methodology: a) The optical absorptance of different electrodes is compared instead of the transmittance. The reason for this is that the often-used optical transmittance is strongly linked to the reflectance of the transparent electrode, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the optical properties of the substrate, the film thickness, and the surface texture. In addition, while the transmittance is normally measured on a flat glass substrate, several solar cell absorbers feature textured surfaces (e.g., silicon heterojunction solar cells[1]) or randomly oriented grains (e.g., CIGS and CZTS[107]), which increase the roughness of the films and influence the reflectance of the layered stacks. To make an accurate and fair comparison of the amount of light that is parasitically absorbed by a transparent electrode, independent of the substrate and surface roughness, we therefore use the absorptance (A) value, defined as A = 1 – TT – TR, where TT is the total transmittance and TR is the total reflectance. b) The spectrally weighted absorptance (Aweighted,x, where x is the solar cell or OLED) of the electrodes is compared rather than the absorptance at a single wavelength. The spectrally weighted absorptance takes into account the relevant wavelength range and the intensity of the light source that is absorbed or emitted by the device. This is expressed by d d weighted, light, light, 1, 2, 1 2 A I A I x x x x x ∫ ∫ λ λ λ λ ( ) ( ) = λ λ λ λ (3) where A(λ) is the absorptance of the transparent electrode as a function of wavelength, Ilight,x is the intensity of the light source spectrum, and λ1,x and λ2,x are the wavelength’s range as defined by the application. In solar cells, Ilight,solar is the 1 sun air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum. The wavelength range (λ1 to λ2) depends on the type of solar cell. Here, we use the wavelength range from λ1 = 320 to λ2 = 1200 nm (Figure 2a), which covers the range of most of the solar cells analyzed here. In OLEDs, Ilight,OLED is the emission spectrum of a white OLED in the wavelength range from λ1 = 380 to λ2 = 780 nm (Figure 3a).

Transparent Electrodes as Front Contacts in Solar Cells Figure 2 shows the standardized terrestrial solar irradiance spectrum (AM1.5) under 1 sun intensity (a) and the external quantum efficiencies (QE) (left axis, b) for a range of archetypical high-efficiency solar cells that employ transparent electrodes, namely perovskite, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and perovskite-SHJ tandem solar cells. The absorptance curves of various transparent electrodes are presented in Figure 2b (right axis). Figure 2b shows that the front transparent electrode in any solar cell should have a sufficiently large (>3 eV) optical band gap to avoid absorption losses in the visible range of the spectrum. This requirement is already fulfilled by several TCOs.[23] For example, the optical band gap (Eg) of sputtered ITO, IZO and IO:H films are between 3.5 and 3.8 eV.[111] Transparent electrodes with low absorptance in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum (transparent electrodes with low FCA) are required for CIGS, SHJ and multi-junction devices, such as perovskite-onsilicon[109,112] and perovskite-on-CIGS[113] tandem solar cells, as these devices employ optical absorbers that are active in this range of the spectrum. These tandem approaches are new highefficiency photovoltaic technologies, with a potential to reach about 30% efficiency,[114,115] clearly underscoring the critical importance and urgency of designing transparent electrodes with exceptionally large broadband transparency. By comparing the absorptance curves of the TCOs in Figure 2b, we observe that hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H)[116] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

KGaA, Weinheim (9 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT and cerium/hydrogen or tungsten/hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H, IWO:H, respectively)[117] offer the best optical properties, with an absorptance below 2% from 400 up to 1200 nm. Another notable TCO with minimal absorptance in the NIR-IR range is doped CdO[52] (not shown here). These TCOs have an excellent optical-electrical trade-off, potentially from their exceptionally high electron mobilities, on the order of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, combined with their relatively low free carrier densities. More specifically, in the case of IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H, the free carrier densities are usually below 3 × 1020 cm−3. Their electron mobilities are about 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IO:H and IWO:H and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ICO:H, resulting in Rsh in the range of 30–40 Ω sq−1 (Figure 2c), which are excellent values for high-efficiency solar cell applications. The high free electron mobilities in these polycrystalline hydrogenated In2O3-based materials are explained by the formation of large grains, together with possible grain-boundary passivation by hydrogen, as well as the fact that H atoms in the film do not contribute significantly to ionized or neutral impurity scattering.[118,119] IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H have been successfully applied in SHJ,[117,120–122] CIGS,[123] and perovskite solar cells.[124] Amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) is another TCO with low FCA and good electrical properties. Even with an amorphous structure (different from polycrystalline IO:H and ICO:H), IZO can have electron mobilities up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for free carrier densities between 1–3 × 1020 cm−3.[111,125,126] An attractive feature of these TCOs is that they already have excellent optoelectronic properties in their as-deposited state; these properties are not much affected by post-deposition annealing and offer opportunities for temperature-sensitive applications. A possible drawback is their relatively high absorption in the UV-vis range due to optical band gap narrowing.[111] This is a common effect in amorphous materials caused by exponential subgap tails due to disorder (also called Urbach tails)[127,128] and the presence of defects that introduce subgap absorption centers.[129] The application of IZO in solar cells has been demonstrated in SHJ[111] and perovskite solar cells.[130] A particularly attractive feature of all indium-oxide-based electrodes (including ITO) is the fact that their refractive index is close to 2. This is approximately the geometric mean of the refractive indices of air and typical solar cell absorbers (such as silicon), which gives these materials very good anti-reflective coating (ARC) properties.

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (10 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT ideal thickness is dictated by quarter wave-length conditions, corresponding to about 75 nm for the AM1.5G spectrum, ensuring a reflection minimum at 600 nm. Boron-doped ZnO (BZO) has attractive properties for certain photovoltaic devices as well.[131–133] A BZO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1 essentially shows the same low NIR-IR absorptance as IO:H (30 Ω sq−1), even though much thicker BZO films are required to obtain such results. Regardless of the thickness, BZO maintains its excellent optical properties for two reasons: low free carrier densities (in the order of 1019 cm−3) and a particular increase of electron mobility with increasing film thickness (due to its pyramidal shaped grains).[134,135] Electron mobilities up to 58 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in BZO films post-treated with H2 plasma.[136] The red curve in Figure 2b shows the absorptance of a BZO electrode with 10 Ω sq−1 Rsh. This very low Rsh is achieved by increasing the thickness of the film by 1 to 5 µm. Given the required thickness to obtain sufficiently conductive films, BZO films are not used as antireflective coatings. However, due to their self-texturing tendency during CVD, they offer excellent light-trapping conditions for thin-film photovoltaics, as evidenced by their successful application in thin-film silicon[137,138] and CIGS solar cells.[139] The absorptances of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) with 30 Ω sq−1111 and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with 15 Ω sq−1140 are already much higher than those of IO:H, IWO:H, ICO:H, IZO, and BZO. The high parasitic absorption in the NIR range of these materials originates from their high free carrier densities, required because their electron mobilities are lower than 40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Current losses linked to parasitic absorption in the front ITO in SHJ cells or in the front FTO in perovskiteSHJ tandem cells have been analyzed in ref. [140] and ref. [141], respectively. The popularity of both TCOs for application as window layers in solar cells is partly due to their chemical and environmental stability, as well as their demonstrated largescale production.[142,143] It is important to note that while IO:H and ICO:H are excellent electrodes for photovoltaic cells, they are still relatively new materials and their fabrication at production-relevant scales is yet to be demonstrated. One of the challenges for upscaling hydrogenated indium oxides is to control the introduction of water molecules during deposition (to include the H dopants). Approaches such as the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) would be, for example, a controlled way to grow high mobility IO:H.[118] With the obvious efforts to replace ITO with high-mobility TCOs, we expect the development of industry-relevant techniques for their fabrication. Aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes have also been widely used in PV devices.[144–146] AZO, like BZO, is attractive due to its non-toxicity and the abundance of Zn in the Earth’s crust. The low FOM value compared to, e.g., BZO, is due to the higher FCA in AZO. AZO is polycrystalline, with a columnar-like structure, forming grain boundaries that limit its mobility (typically on the order of 10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1). Postthermal treatments are known to improve the resistivity of AZO by increasing its free carrier density.[147] The electron mobility of sputtered AZO has been successfully increased up to 40–67 cm2 V−1 s−1 by incorporating a capping layer and applying a high-temperature (650°C) annealing step.[148] Considering the temperature restriction of several devices, low Rsh values are therefore mainly achieved by increasing Ne, at the cost of an inflated FCA. Although the FOM values for sputtered and chemical-bath-deposited (CBD) AZO are similar, deposition from solution presents some advantages: it is a simple and low-cost process,[149] and it is gentle, preventing physical damage to the substrates or active device layers where the material is deposited. Next to CBD, ALD and CVD are gentle deposition techniques as well and used for fabrication of several of the transparent electrodes discussed here. The ITO/Ag/AZO layer stack suffers the highest absorptance, from 500 to 800 nm, of all the curves compared. This is related to large reflectance and absorption losses in the thin metal film that provides the very low Rsh values. The shown absorptance is from[150]; however, approaches to improve the optical properties, e.g., by oxidizing the intermediate Ag film, have been demonstrated in subsequent reports.[151] While these films are not optimal for high efficiency solar cells, the possibility of sputtering these layers at room temperature, the limited total thickness of the trilayer-stack (<100 nm) and the ductility of the intermediate metal layer, with a thickness between 8 and 12 nm, make these electrodes interesting for flexible optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the high reflectance of these layers has been used to create a resonant optical cavity to trap the light in organic solar cells and, as a consequence, to increase their quantum efficiencies.[152] A summary of the approaches to optimize these types of dielectric/metal/dielectric layers for application in organic photovoltaic devices is found in ref. [153]. Finally, the absorptance curve of a monolayer of graphene, as reported in ref. [41], indicates that the use of such a material can be beneficial for applications in the NIR-IR range. However, in the visible range, the absorptance is already much higher than several of the other shown transparent electrodes. This is also reflected by the fact that a realistic Rsh value of 1000 Ω sq−1154 results in the lowest solar-cell FOM of all transparent electrodes, as shown in Figure 2d, casting doubt on whether monolayer graphene will ever find applications in highly efficient solar cells. As noted earlier, doping approaches and multilayers of graphene reduce the Rsh to more device-relevant values, but this is at the expense of increased absorptance.[41] Figure 2c shows normalized weighted absorptance as a function of Rsh for the various transparent electrodes compared here. Dashed lines of constant FOM are given for reference. These dashed lines highlight the observation that FOM converges for cases of very large Rsh values with very low absorptance or vice versa. Therefore, in Figure 2c we restricted the comparison of FOM values for transparent electrodes to a maximum of Rsh = 100 Ω sq−1, which is a relevant value for applications in photovoltaic devices. Figure 2d compares the FOM of transparent electrodes classified by thickness. The electrodes are sorted from left to right with the thickest electrodes, poorly suited for flexible applications on the left, and thinner electrodes, which present higher resistance to mechanical bending and stretching, on the right.[18] Note that Figure 2 considers a very general case by using only the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum under a 1 Sun intensity to evaluate transparent electrodes for any solar cell. To calculate the FOM for a specific solar cell, Equation (3) can be modified to include the quantum efficiency of the device: www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

Transparent Electrodes as Front Electrodes in OLEDs To evaluate FOM of transparent electrodes geared towards applications in OLEDs (a similar case would apply for bottomemitting LEDs), we use a white OLED spectrum simulated with SETFOS.[155] Figure 3 shows the white OLED spectrum used as Ilight (λ) in Equation (4) to evaluate the weighted absorptance of transparent electrodes. Contrary to solar cells, applications in LEDs, or OLEDs for lighting, displays or touch screens feature a narrower wavelength range at which the transparent electrode should have minimum absorptance, relaxing the optical requirements as compared with solar cells. In fact, effects such as the Burstein-Moss shift or FCA in TCOs have only a minimal influence on the parasitic absorption for these applications. Nevertheless, we can observe in Figure 3b that the absorptance of the TCOs still follows a similar trend as in Figure 2b,c, with ZnO:B, ICO:H, and IWO:H the transparent electrodes with the lowest absorptance and highest conductivity, and therefore exhibiting the highest FOMs. In this comparison, we have also included the case of a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) combined with metal grids embedded on a polymer matrix.[156] ZTO is an amorphous TCO, with sufficient conductivity to be utilized in combination with metal grids as the anode in large-area flexible OLEDs. In fact, it was demonstrated that with the same type of metal grids, ZTO devices performed better than the reference ITO OLEDs.[157] As observed in Figure 3c, the combination of the exceptionally low absorptance and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1 for ZnO:B, or even a lower Rsh (1 Ω sq−1) provided by the metal grids in the case of the hybrid ZTO + metal grid electrode, gives the highest FOM to these two transparent electrodes. The large thickness of ZnO:B, required to achieve low Rsh values, may prevent its application in flexible devices, however, as indicated in Figure 3d. For such applications, hybrid electrodes based on ZTO and metal grids may offer a better alternative.[156] However, in rigid top-emitting LEDs, ZnO:B, when grown by LPCVD, has the additional advantage of an intrinsic pyramidal surface texture with known light scattering properties,[137] improving light out coupling.[158] TCO/metal/TCO stacks and Ag NWs are on par in our FOM comparison. Although neither features simultaneously optimal Rsh and absorptance, these transparent electrodes offer properties that are interesting for flexible devices. For our comparison, we use representative absorptance and Rsh data of Ag NWs taken from the current literature.[8,95,159,160] However, we note that intensive research efforts are ongoing on Ag NWs, promising further performance improvements. Such improvements will mainly be achieved by increased fabrication control and deposition of metal grids with submicron-width lines,[161] development of hybrid approaches to improve stability under corrosive and oxidation conditions, as well as improved adhesion to the substrates. A monolayer of graphene with a sheet resistivity of 1000 Ω sq−1 gives, by far, the lowest FOM for photovoltaics. We note that for the case of OLEDs, the FOM is reaching a comparable value relative to other transparent electrodes in the list. This is because the absorptance values of the various transparent electrodes are comparably low in the relevant wavelength range for these devices (the visible light spectrum). Nevertheless, the 1000 Ω sq−1 Rsh associated with a monolayer of graphene raises the concern of high resistive losses when applied in devices. Hybrid approaches offer help in such cases. As an example, several laboratory-scale OLEDs and LEDs have used graphene-based electrodes, i.e., hybrid nanowires and graphene, conductive polymer and graphene and graphene oxide layers.[35,162] However, only a few groups have demonstrated the use of a single layer of graphene as the anode in small-area OLED devices.[163] 5. Other Specific Requirements of Transparent Electrodes for Solar Cells and OLEDs 5.1. Fabrication Compatibility As listed in Table 1, fabrication compatibility, i.e., processing temperature, chemical inertness, and non-damaging methods, is also an important selection criterion for transparent electrodes to be used in specific devices. For example, the thermal budget of OLEDs, SHJ, CIGS, CdTe, and perovskite-based solar cells is below 200 °C.[164,165] Clearly, fabrication of transparent electrodes on plastic flexible substrates also requires strict fabrication temperatures below approximately 150 °C. In this context, all electrodes depicted in Figure 2 and 3 were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C, during both deposition and post-deposition annealing (when applicable). The only exception is FTO, which is normally deposited or post-treated at temperatures well above 200 °C.[166–168] Amorphous TCOs such as IZO, offer the greatest flexibility, as they can be deposited nominally at room temperature and do not require post-deposition annealing. Such TCOs have demonstrated their value in SHJ and perovskite solar cell fabrication.[111,130] As mentioned earlier, gentle deposition on underlying layers can also be a critical factor in electrode choice and raises questions about the use of well-established physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition for certain applications. Sputter damage, caused by UV radiation and particle bombardment, is a known phenomenon in organic,[16] SHJ,[15] and perovskite[169] solar cells as well as flexible displays. Solutions to overcome such damage include the use of remote plasma sources,[170] the use of gently deposited buffer layers[171] or further improvements to solution-based deposition processes to improve the density and purity of TCO films to achieve high electron mobilities at low temperatures.[45,172] 5.2. Interfaces with the Transparent Electrodes Good electrical and chemical matching at the interface between transparent electrodes and their adjacent layers in a device is another criterion for electrode selection and optimization. This interface can be shared with the carrier-collection or carrier-injection layers, but also with the metal grid of the device. www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (12 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT Large-area optoelectronic devices often require a metal grid, which is normally deposited on the transparent electrode, to minimize the lateral resistance and, thus, voltage loss over large areas. As an example, we present a sketch of a cross section of a SHJ solar cell in Figure 4 to highlight the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/TCO/metal interfaces with the corresponding band diagram. Transversely, minimizing electrical losses is equally important. Again, in SHJ solar cells, the main contributors to such transverse resistance are the contact resistances (ρc) at the metal/TCO interface (label 1 in Figure 4b) and, even more so, at the TCO/a-Si:H interface (label 3 in Figure 4b); the intrinsic resistance of the TCO in the transverse direction (label 2 in Figure 4b) is usually sufficiently low to be neglected. Across the metal/TCO interface, the dominant carrier transport mechanism is field emission, for which the contact resistivity (ρc) is expressed as exp with E = 4 field emission c B * 0 E qh N m e ρ φ π ε ε ( ) ∝     ∞ (6) where φB is the barrier height and E is the tunneling energy.[174] This equation makes evident the improvement in ρc from the increased carrier density, Ne, of the transparent electrode, which suggests the use of bilayer TCOs that feature high surface but low bulk Ne to minimize ρc and FCA simultaneously.[121] Practically, the TCO/metal contact resistance is commonly characterized by the transfer length method (TLM).[175] In terms of metallization, screen-printed, low-temperature Ag pastes are commonly used, especially in industry. In such a case, ρc values on the order of 10−5 Ω cm[2] are typical, as is the case of the ITO/Ag and a-IZO/Ag interfaces, commonly used in solar cells.[111,176] Electroplated Cu can offer advantages in terms of line resistivity and material cost compared with printed Ag electrodes. However, due to the ease of diffusing electroplated Cu into silicon, where it can act as a carrier lifetime killer, its application to photovoltaics is not evident. Interestingly, ITO forms an excellent Cu diffusion barrier. The low measuredρc value for the Cu/ITO interface (ρc < 10−4 cm−3) validates this combination for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.[176] Contrary to the case of TCOs, achievement of sufficiently low ρc between the metal and Ag NWs or graphene electrodes is still an unresolved challenge.[100] To extract or inject carriers efficiently in solar cells or OLEDs, respectively, the interface between the transparent electrode and the active layer of the device (absorber or emitter) should have a negligible contact resistance (ρc) as well.[177] A main cause of this resistance is the combined effect of Fermi-level pinning at the interface and work function mismatch between adjacent materials.[177] This causes the formation of an interfacial energy barrier, characterized by a certain height and depletion width penetrating both materials. Such barriers can in principle be overcome by thermionic (field) emission, evidenced by lowered ρc values with increasing operating temperatures.[178] The barrier width can also be narrowed by increasing surface doping to increase field emission across the interface, similar to the metal/TCO case. As an alternative to doping, the work function of TCOs can be modified by surface treatments (UV, ozone, oxygen plasma),[179] or by the application of specific interfacial buffer layers with optimized work functions. The work function and band alignment of various TCOs for selected devices have been studied by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).[11,12,180] A selected list of TCOs and metals with their respective work function values as reported in literature is found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). In metal NWs and graphene electrodes, the work function cannot be intrinsically modified; however, a common approach is the application of a capping layer or creating hybrid electrodes with high or low work function polymers[177] or metal oxide films.[181,182] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

In either case, collected carriers need to overcome in principle several barriers, namely at the c-Si/a-Si:H, the a-Si:H/TCO, and the TCO/metal interface (not drawn). The first barrier is caused by band offsets. The second one can be caused by Fermi-level pinning at the interface and insufficient doping of a-Si:H and TCO. Because the TCO is normally n-type, an Ohmic contact for electrons is in principle guaranteed on the rear side. Transport at the TCO(n)/a-Si:H(p) interface occurs by band-to-band tunneling with photogenerated holes efficiently recombining with electrons from the TCO.[173] © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (13 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT 5.3. Stability Under Thermal and Humid Environments Environmental stability of transparent electrodes is also of critical importance when integrating them in devices. Damp heat tests performed under standard conditions of 85% humidity at 85°C for prolonged time (1000 h) were used to demonstrate the high environmental stability of ITO and IZO electrodes.[183] IO:H and AZO, on the contrary, showed poorer electrical stability under damp heat conditions mainly due to the introduction of water at grain boundaries.[183,184] In the case of IO:H it has been recently demonstrated that damp heat degradation is strongly linked to the hydrogen content in the films. IO:H films with hydrogen content lower than 5 at.% exhibit stable electrical properties after exposure to DH conditions.[185] The application of capping layers, e.g., capping IO:H with a very thin and dense layer of ITO, improves the environmental stability of the electrodes.[183] In terms of thermal stability, full-device fabrication might require temperature steps that could modify the carrier density or microstructure in TCOs, degrading the optoelectronic properties. TCOs with good temperature stability are mainly multicompound amorphous materials, such as IZO and ZTO.[125,186] In nanowire networks, clustering of the network due to a temperature step would increase the roughness of the electrode and induce the formation of shorts in e.g. organic devices. In addition to temperature, UV exposure may also detrimentally affect some transparent electrodes. Conductive polymers used in organic devices and hybrid electrodes, such as nanowire-based and metal grids embedded in a conductive polymer, yellow with exposure to UV and temperature.[187] In terms of chemical stability, cleaning of the substrate before OLED or perovskite cell deposition can cause damage to the transparent electrodes. SnO2, ITO, and a-ZnSnO are among the TCOs with the highest chemical stabilities[146] and therefore are fully compatible with industry-based processes to fabricate, e.g., OLED devices.[157] 6. Perspectives The continuous drive to increase solar cell efficiency, as well as the push for improved performance of several other optoelectronic devices, requires the development of transparent electrodes with next-generation requirements, including ultrahigh broadband transparency, high conductivity, adaptability, and composition mainly from abundant elements. The best example of a device that requires premium broadband transparent electrodes on its front is the perovskite-silicon multi-junction solar cell, which, as indicated in Figure 2, aims at active absorption of the broadest photon-energy range. The electrodes in this type of solar cell need to feature a wide band gap, low FCA, and relatively low sheet resistivity. In addition, they should be deposited without damaging the carrier-selective contacts in the silicon cell, or the perovskite layers, and cannot be annealed. The best solution for this is a very high mobility TCO, deposited at room-temperature using a gentle deposition technique. Amorphous indium-based TCOs are the best candidates; however, widening of their band gap remains a challenge. Further exploration of materials to find the right dopants or compounds that open up the band gap or of new material systems with tuned compositions and microstructures is just one path to the discovery of amorphous low-temperature and gently-deposited high mobility broadband transparent electrodes. In terms of deposition, further development of high-end deposition techniques, such as ALD, low-temperature solution-based deposition processes, or new PVD system designs that avoid the direct exposure of the substrate to the plasma during deposition (e.g., high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation,[188,189] or facing target sputtering[190]), is just one path to the development of ultra-high performance TCOs and TCOs/ device interfaces. Material design is also expected to play a decisive role in the development of Earth-abundant transparent electrodes, as well as for the discovery of high-performance transparent and conductive materials especially with p-type conductivity. Much is expected from high-throughput screenings using the combination of computational and experimental methods, looking for new design principles and experimenting with various synthesis approaches. On the p-type TCO side, recent investigations of metal-based oxysulfides or non-oxide chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) or pnictides (N, P) as potential p-type transparent conducting candidates show promise in reducing the hole effective mass and to increase conductivity. Recent progress on sulfide-based p-type transparent conductors has enabled device demonstrations that employ p-type transparent contacts. For example, low-temperature synthesized Cu-Zn-S has been applied as a hole-selective contact in solar cells with n-type absorbers.[81] The scalability and low processing temperature of these p-type transparent conductors merits further material and device exploration. Aside from transparency and conductivity, other specific properties (stretchability, self-healing, antibacterial properties) of transparent electrodes are becoming increasingly important as they are being implemented into thin, lightweight and wearable devices that require both ease-of-use and robustness. Examples of these are fiber-like electrodes,[191,192] consisting of fully integrated conductive fibers with a transparent matrix or skin-integrated circuits and optoelectronics that require transparent electrodes fabricated with non-toxic and biocompatible materials. The combination of optoelectronic and environmental or mechanical requirements is in many cases best achieved by hybrid approaches that integrate polymers and high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Lastly, in addition to the three different approaches to create transparent electrodes presented earlier in the manuscript, a largely unexplored area is the use of photonic crystals and metamaterials. In this case, light management through structures with metallic conductivity could simultaneously provide transparency and charge transport, creating transparent conductive structures.

Ager, and Christophe Ballif* DOI: 10.1002/aelm.201600529 1. Introduction The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented entrance in both variety and volume of optoelectronic devices into the consumer-electronics market. With this growth, there has also been a transition to devices that offer attractive features such as semi-transparency, flexibility, stretchability, tactility, and energy With the development of new generations of optoelectronic devices that combine high performance and novel functionalities (e.g., flexibility/bendability, adaptability, semi or full transparency), several classes of transparent electrodes have been developed in recent years. These range from optimized transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), which are historically the most commonly used transparent electrodes, to new electrodes made from nano- and 2D materials (e.g., metal nanowire networks and graphene), and to hybrid electrodes that integrate TCOs or dielectrics with nanowires, metal grids, or ultrathin metal films. Here, the most relevant transparent electrodes developed to date are introduced, their fundamental properties are described, and their materials are classified according to specific application requirements in high efficiency solar cells and flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). This information serves as a guideline for selecting and developing appropriate transparent electrodes according to intended application requirements and functionality. Dr. M. Morales-Masis, Prof. C.

Woods-Robinson Applied Science and Technology Graduate Group University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720, USA efficiency. Most such devices with these attractive features require transparent electrodes that enable these functionalities. Sustainable fabrication of transparent electrodes with readily available raw materials and their recyclability are also important criteria for successful commercialization. This article reviews the status of the development of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic devices. In the first section, we list the relevant properties that these electrodes require for their intended applications, including transparency and conductivity. We also describe other factors that affect device operation or contribute to device efficiency. As an example, highly efficient silicon heterojunction solar cells can generate short-circuit current densities higher than 40 mA cm−2 that must be laterally transported to the metal contacts of the cells.[1] Such large photogenerated current densities require transparent electrodes that can carry the current densities over large surface areas without excessive power dissipation. The electrodes in some light-emitting diodes (LEDs) must also transport similarly large current densities. In the second part of this report, we describe the distinct material systems that simultaneously enable transparency and conductivity and that are available either at the laboratory or the commercial scale. In the third section, we classify transparent electrodes according to their applicability to various types of highly efficient solar cells and to organic and inorganic LEDs (OLEDs, LEDs). To this classification, we add the processing compatibility requirements for actual device fabrication and electrode integration. Because reviews on each class of transparent electrodes are available (e.g., on metal oxide electrodes for displays and thin-film transistors,[2,3] on properties of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs);[4–7] and on general properties of graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanostructures[8]), the last section presents transparent electrodes by mostly focusing on the technological development, applications, and our perspective on future developments of inorganic electrodes. 2. Application Requirements of Transparent Electrodes in Optoelectronic Devices Typical optoelectronic devices that require transparent electrodes include touchscreens, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), smart windows, most types of solar cells (e.g., thin-film silicon, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and silicon-wafer-based www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (2 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT heterojunction solar cells), OLEDs, and LEDs. In general terms, the electrodes in solar cells should simultaneously guarantee unhindered current flow out of a large device area and efficient light coupling into the active area of the cell.[9] Displays and OLEDs have very similar requirements for their electrodes: current flow in and light coupling out. It is therefore tempting to suggest that all optoelectronic devices have identical requirements in terms of optical transmittance-lateral conductivity properties.[10] However, optimal performance from each type of device can be achieved only by specific optimization of its electrodes, such as minimized contact resistance with the adjacent active layer of the device (e.g., by work function matching),[11–13] low-damage deposition processing,[14–16] conformal film deposition, stretchability and bendability,[17–19] or temperature stability. In this context, we present the main requirements for transparent electrodes in each type of device in Table 1. We note that lateral conductivity is evaluated as sheet resistance (Rsh = 1/σd, where σ is the electrical conductivity of the material and d is the thickness of the electrode). As a device-relevant parameter, Rsh is used for comparison of the transparent electrodes discussed in Section 4 rather than conductivity, which is an intrinsic material property. Because of the broadness of this topic, we hereafter narrow our focus to transparent electrodes for high efficiency solar cells, LEDs and OLEDs. 3. Material Systems for Transparent Electrodes Only a few material systems simultaneously offer optical transparency and electrical conductivity. In fact, there is always a trade-off between these properties, which fortunately can often be tuned for specific applications. The first and most traditional strategy for developing a transparent conductor is to find a material that intrinsically offers both characteristics, i.e., a wide band-gap material with n- or p-type conduction. Classic examples of n-type doped transparent conductors are Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), F-doped SnO2 (FTO), doped zinc oxide (ZnO), and cadmium oxide (CdO).[4,22–25] Conductive polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) also partially offer both intrinsic properties.[26–28] A second strategy consists of dimensional engineering using conductive, but not necessarily transparent materials (e.g., metals or carbon-based materials[29]) and their arrangement in such a way that the system conducts in one direction and is transparent in the other. This is achieved by arranging the conductive material in either a very thin layer or a mesh of (nano-)wires.[8,30–32] The use of 2D materials can be considered as a third approach, with graphene as the most prominent material.[33–35] The latter material offers in theory inplane (ballistic) conductance, while being quite transparent due to their limited thickness. Also available are hybrid approaches that combine the properties of several material systems into a single functional electrode,[36–39] such as embedded metal nanowire networks in a dielectric matrix. Below, we consider three approaches that build on inorganic transparent electrodes developed in recent years, their fundamental properties, their fabrication processes, and their position in the market either as raw materials or utilized in commercial devices. To classify the electrodes based on its technology maturity we used the concept Monica Morales-Masis is team leader for transparent electrodes development at the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory (PVLab) of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

The TRL are given in a range from 1 to 9, with 1 being the lowest level of technology readiness (at the scientific study stage, observation of basic principles) and 9 the highest level (when a technology reaches commercialization). As commented above, Table 2 focuses on inorganic materials, extensive reviews of the conductive polymer approach have previously been published.[26,28,40] 3.1. Transparent Conductors 3.1.1. N-Type Transparent Conductors Highly doped (degenerate) metal oxides, commonly known as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), are the most widely used and studied transparent electrodes to date. Conventional TCO materials are tin-, zinc-, cadmium- and indium-based oxides (SnO2, ZnO, CdO, In2O3). Other reported materials with TCO properties include titanium oxide (TiO2) and calcium aluminate (12CaO⋅7Al2O3).[42,43] Conventional TCOs are binary systems, mainly polycrystalline in nature and doped with halides, group XIII, or XV elements,[6] almost always forming n-type semiconductors. Recently, multi-compound oxides (e.g., IGZO, ZTO, IZO),[44] aiming at improved mechanical properties and thermal stability due to their amorphous nature, have also been widely studied and have electrical properties that are often on par with their polycrystalline counterparts.[44,45] The simultaneous ability of binary and multi-compound metal oxides to offer high optical transmittance in a broad photon-energy range and high electrical conductivity is attributed to their specific electronic structure. Conventional TCOs are mainly formed by metal atoms with the (n – 1)d10ns[2] electronic configuration.[44,46] Interaction of the metal s states (Ms) and oxygen p states (Op) results in the formation of a wide band gap (Eg > 3 eV), allowing the transmittance of photons in the visible range and below.[47] The valence band (VB) is composed of occupied oxygen 2p states, whereas the conduction band (CB) is formed by an overlapping Ms-Op-Ms network. This Ms-Op-Ms network results in a highly dispersed band (observed as a large curvature at the conduction band edge, see figure in Table 2, column 2, row 2) which leads to a low effective electron mass ( e * m ) in the range of 0.2–0.3m0, where m0 is the resting mass of the electron.[48] The electron mobility (μ) in dispersed bands in the relaxation time approximation depends on e * m and the average time between two scattering events (or carrier relaxation time) (τ), according to the following expression: e * e m µ τ = (1) τ is influenced by all possible scattering mechanisms relevant to electron transport in the films: grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials,[49] microstructural defects such as voids or stacking faults, point defects such as neutral or ionized impurities and lattice vibrations (i.e., phonon scattering). To increase the free electron mobility in TCOs, a low e * m , low free-carrier density and low-defective material are thus required. Typical TCO electron mobilities range from 10 up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.[3] The electron mobilities of polycrystalline and amorphous TCOs can be very similar. This similarity is generally attributed to the spherical symmetry of the Ms orbitals, which has a marginal effect on the angular variations in the Ms-Op-Msnetwork; this network forms the conduction band.

Types of transparent conductive electrodes. The properties that allow simultaneous transmittance and conductivity, i.e., wide band gap and degeneration conduction in n-type TCOs (first two rows in column 2), metallic conduction by percolation through sparse nanowire networks (first two rows in column 3), and ballistic transport in the specific case of a monolayer of graphene, allowing transparency because of its 1-atom thickness (row 2, column 4).[41] The materials and deposition techniques used to fabricate these transparent electrodes are listed along with their market readiness and estimated technology readiness level (TRL). © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (5 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT turn gives rise to a large dispersion of the conduction band and therefore a small e * m . Various types of indium-oxide-based TCOs also exhibit high electron mobilities, as discussed further in Section 4. The electrical conductivity (σ) is proportional to μ and the free-carrier density (Ne) as σ = eμNe. Ne can be increased in TCOs by doping; typically used extrinsic dopants are halides, group XIII and XV elements. Intrinsic dopants can also be used, with oxygen vacancies the primary example.[6] Intrinsically, the Fermi level (EF) lies in most known TCOs close to the conduction band facilitating extrinsic n-type doping. Such doping shifts EF inside the conduction band, forming a degenerate n-type semiconductor, which also leads to further widening of the optical band gap (Eg) following the Burstein–Moss relation: ΔEg≈ Ne2/3.[5,53,54] Free-carrier densities of TCOs range from 1017 up to 1021 cm−3 (for comparison, metals have Ne on the order of 1022 cm−3). Although increasing Ne can be beneficial to the optical transmittance in the UV-vis range (wider optical Eg), such an increase has negative effects in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum due to parasitic optical absorption by free carriers in the conduction band. This effect is called free carrier absorption (FCA), which is well described by the classical Drude theory.[55,56] The direct relation between the absorption coefficient (α) and Ne for the case of highly doped semiconductors is given by:[5,57] 4 2 3 e 2 0 3 e * 2 opt a e N c n m λ π ε µ ( ) = (2) where λ is the photon wavelength, n is the refractive index, and μopt the optical mobility. It is important to note here that the μopt might differ from the Hall mobility (μHall) since the former is not affected by macroscopic scattering effects as grain-boundaries or film dislocations. Therefore, in polycrystalline films, μopt is often referred as in-grain mobility.[56,58] Equation (2) indicates that FCA (AFCA = 1 –e−αd, with A the absorptance and d is the thickness of the film), will increase with Ne and d. To minimize FCA (a strict requirement for application in efficient solar cells), Ne should be reduced and μ maximized. The absorptance curves and their correlation with the electrical and microstructural properties of distinct TCOs are presented in Section 4 and Figure 2. A full derivation of Equation (2) is given in the Supporting Information. 3.1.2. P-type Transparent Conductors All high-performance TCOs used in commercial applications are n-type. Comparable transparent p-type conductors have yet to be developed. If made available, they could be used in a number of applications, including as electrodes that could offer carrier selectivity and enable carrier collection in photovoltaic devices, as interconnect layers (i.e., recombination junctions) in tandem photovoltaics and as electrodes for fully transparent electronics. There have been some reports of transparent p-type conductors in the literature but their conductivities and figures of merit remain orders of magnitude lower than those of n-type TCOs (Figure 1). The difficulty in finding optimal p-type TCOs stems largely from the specific electronic structure of candidate wide-gap metal oxides, consisting of a highly localized oxygen 2p valence band with a large hole effective mass ( h * m > 1m0, compared with 0.2–0.3m0 for n-type) and thus a very low hole mobility, cf. Equation (1).[59] In addition, the valence band maximum (VBM) of most oxides is energetically situated deeply below the vacuum level, resulting in a high ionization potential. This impedes p-type doping, mainly due to compensation (i.e., “hole killing”) by intrinsic defect generation of the intentionally introduced p-dopants.[60] To improve the mobility by achieving high crystal purity (and minimal scattering), most p-type TCOs, like their n-type counterparts, require high synthesis temperatures that jeopardize their use in devices with sensitive thermal budgets. Fortunately, there are material design principles that can be employed to increase the mobility while maintaining wide optical band gaps in p-type metal oxides. The first such principle is to alloy a wide-gap metal oxide with Cu+1 to create CuxMyOz and then to hybridize the Cu+1 closed-shell 3d[10] electrons with O2p orbitals. This approach, which delocalizes the valence band and thus decreases h * m , was used to demonstrate the first p-TCO, delafossite CuAlO2, in 1997.[61] With a free carrier density of holes of Nh = 1.3 × 1017 cm−3 and a hole mobility at ≈10 cm2 V−1 s−1, the conductivity (<1 S cm−1) was much lower than of n-type TCOs. Subsequently, other Cu-based delafossites with Al replaced by other metal cations, such as Cr,[62] Fe,[63] Sc,[64] and Y,[65] were investigated with oxygen intercalation and various synthesis methods (and thus, various microstructures) with the aim of decreasing the dopant compensation and increasing mobility (Figure 1). Recently, the CuCrO2 has been explored with promising results; Mg-doped CuCrO2 has the highest p-type conductivity reported for an oxide to date, 220 S cm−1. In related work cationic and anion substitution and the role of Cr vacancies in this material has been studied.[66,67] High conductivity has also been shown experimentally in non-Cu metal oxides, most notably spinel-structured TCOs, such as NiCo2O4,[68,69] perovskites-structured TCOs, such as SrInxTi1–xO3 and SrxLa1–xCrO3,[70,71] and amorphous or composite oxides, such as ZnO·Rh2O3 and In:MoO3.[72,73] Other oxides, such as doped Cr2O3 and Ba2BiTaO6, have promise but remain to be synthesized with high conductivities.[74,75] A second, more recently employed approach is to look beyond oxides. Interestingly, one of the first transparent conductors, discovered by Karl Baedeker in 1907, was a nonoxide, p-type degenerate semiconductor, CuI.[76,77] Non-oxide wide-gap (direct and indirect) semiconductors with P, S, or N anions are attractive candidates for p-type materials discovery as their valence bands are more delocalized, leading to a lower hole effective mass.[59,78] This approach has been demonstrated experimentally with Cu-based p-type transparent chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) and oxychalcogenides, most notably CuAlS2, BaCu2S2, BaCu2(S, Se)F, and Cu-Zn-S, resolving one of the issues with the localized O 2p orbital and, upon optimization, reaching conductivities greater than 10 S cm−1.[79–82] The Cu-Zn-S system (also notated CuyS:CuxZn1–xS) includes films grown at temperatures lower than 100°C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), achieving p-type conductivities approaching those of the n-type TCOs (Figure 1).[82] Additionally, Hosono and co-workers have www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (6 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT developed a new class of transparent layered oxychalcogenides LnOCuCh (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y; Ch: S, Se), with conductivities up to 140 S cm−1.[83,84] The transparent conducting materials discussed above present different challenges in terms of optimization and eventual device implementation. The majority of oxide-based p-type conductors discussed have low carrier concentrations (1017 to 1019 cm−3) and conduct via an activated transport or hopping mechanism. As a result, improving conductivity involves both increasing the electron density and the mobility. In the nonoxide chalcogenide-based systems, the band gap tends to be smaller compared to oxides. Additionally, the chalcogenidebased transparent p-type conductors are degenerately doped semiconductors with temperature-independent conductivity, limited by ionized impurity scattering. Compensation by deep donors can reduce both the hole concentration and the mobility, through the increase of ionized impurity scattering. This trade-off has been explored computationally for some specific oxide studies,[85,86] but a more general approach targeting non-oxides would be valuable. Phosphides and nitrides in general have lower hole effective masses, but are less transparent than oxides (phosphide band gaps are on the order of 2 eV). To circumvent this trade-off, a third design principle, proposed by Varley et al., among others,[78] is to explore systems with a low mh and a wide direct band gap. That is, materials with small indirect gaps could still be transparent in the visible so long as their direct gap is larger than 3.1 eV. Their study targeted and screened phosphides, suggesting further exploration of BP and AlP, among others. This approach was recently supported experimentally with pellets of CaCuP (with weak absorption at 2.2 eV and stronger absorption at 2.7 eV), showing conductivities up to 500 S cm−1, although thin films of this material have yet to be synthesized.[87] Figure 1 compares the conductivity of various high-performing transparent n-type and p-type conductors as a function of the synthesis temperature. It can be noted that at high values of conductivity the non-oxides tend to be more strongly absorbing due to their lower band gaps. Finally, as noted earlier, while n-type TCOs can reach high conductivity even in their amorphous state, p-type TCOs exhibit much lower conductivity at high synthesis temperatures. 3.2. Metal Nanowires, Nano- and Microgrids, and Ultrathin Films The use of metal nanowires (NWs) as transparent electrodes is based on the high metallic conductivity of the wires. The nanoto-micrometer-scale diameters of these wires allow the formation of microscale network grids that are sufficiently sparse to avoid dramatic shadow losses in the transparency. As a consequence, the conductivity of such transparent electrodes does not depend on intrinsic materials properties, as is the case for TCOs, but rather on the network density, quality of the nanowires and optimum welding of the network interconnects. In detail, a high density of NWs limits transmittance by increased reflection in the visible. A high aspect ratio (long, small diameter) with good crystalline quality (defect-free to avoid electron scattering and no nanoparticle formation within the wire to avoid plasmonic absorption) and a highly pure metal lead to high-quality nanowires, and passage of electrical current without contact barriers comes from optimum welding of the network interconnects.[88] Silver (Ag) is the most commonly used metal for transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity. Cu and Zn, as well as carbon nanotube (CNT) networks, have also been widely proposed.[8,89] Usually, these networks can be deposited gently on underlying structures, which can be an advantage for processing-sensitive devices, such as organic[90] and perovskite solar cells.[91] Challenges common to all NW network approaches are their poor chemical stability and tendency to oxidize, their large surface roughness, their weak adhesion to the substrate and high contact resistance to adjacent functional layers in devices. To overcome some of these challenges, NWs can be embedded in transparent dielectrics, conductive polymers,[92] graphene oxide,[93] and metal oxides.[94] Stability data on NW electrodes are not widely reported, but recent efforts indicate possibilities to improve the performance of transparent NW electrodes. The properties of Ag NWs, CNTs, and several other nanostructures for applications as transparent electrodes, optimization approaches and performance have been extensively reviewed in ref. [8,89,95] In relation to metallic networks, it is important to mention other recently proposed approaches. One consists of the formation of transparent conductive grid patterns by self-assembly of Ag nanoparticles deposited by ink-jet printing.[96] Another approach, closer to the standard one using macroscopic metal www.advelectronicmat.de Adv.

KGaA, Weinheim (7 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT grids, consists of 3D designs for the metal lines. These designs could redirect the light into the device avoiding shadow losses and forming “effectively transparent contacts”.[97] Ultrathin metal films have also been proposed as transparent conductors. Although these metal films have excellent electrical properties for thicknesses of only a few tens of nanometers, reflectance losses reduce the amount of light that couples effectively in devices, and the absence of a bandgap limits the transparency of the electrodes. Placing these metal films between two transparent, high-refractive-index layers reduces the reflectance of the metal, leading to gains in transmittance in the visible spectrum.[20] The optical absorptance and electrical properties of this type of electrodes are discussed in Section 4. 3.3. Graphene and Other 2D Materials Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely proposed as transparent electrodes, due to their atomic monolayer thicknesses (allowing high optical transmittance) and the possibility of ballistic transport, i.e., non-scattering of electrons even at room temperature. Of these materials, graphene is arguably the leading 2D material, which, despite its lack of a bandgap, was also quickly proposed as a potential transparent conductor.[98,99] A monolayer of graphene can have carrier mobilities above 10 000 cm2 V−1 s−1.[33] So far, such carrier mobility was achievable only in nanometer-scale, free-standing graphene flakes, obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and on films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on boron nitride substrates.[100] When transferring to substrates or upscaling the fabrication of graphene films, defects are introduced, thereby lowering the carrier mobility. Batch-to-batch production of high-quality graphene on large-area substrates, as well as the availability of transfer methods to obtain defect-free, highquality graphene, remain major obstacles in the application of graphene to commercial optoelectronic devices.[101] Moreover, despite its high mobility potential, the conductivity of graphene is low compared with more conventional transparent electrodes, largely because of its intrinsically low free carrier concentration (<1013 cm−3).[98] This may be resolved by impurity doping,[102] intercalation doping[103] and multilayer film growth,[33] all approaches that have resulted in device-relevant Rsh values. A clear advantage of graphene electrodes, like for metal NWs, is their tolerance to bending and stretching.[104] Therefore, for applications in which flexibility and stretchability are the most important requirements and a high Rsh is acceptable (e.g., foldable capacitive touch screens, see Table 1), graphene could be a good material candidate. In addition to graphene, other emerging 2D materials such as phosphorene[105] and stanene (a single layer of Sn, yet to be experimentally realized) have been proposed as promising optoelectronic materials because of their potential to be as transparent and flexible as graphene.[106] Further exploration in this field could lead to 2D-layered materials with the performance required for use as transparent electrodes in flexible, deformable, or even skin-like optoelectronic devices. Table 2 summarizes the above-described transparent electrodes, the property that allows both, conductivity and transmittance, the materials and methods used for fabrication, as well as their general position in the market. 4. Classification of Transparent Electrodes According to the Requirements for Solar Cells and OLEDs The two most important requirements of a high-performance transparent electrode are low optical absorptance and high lateral conductivity (low Rsh). When comparing transparent electrodes, we should remember that optical properties are dependent on wavelength. It is precisely this dependency of the optical properties on wavelength that largely dictates which transparent electrode is best suited to a specific application. Materials that feature low absorptance in the wavelength range at which the active part of the device absorbs or emits light most efficiently should be explored. In this section, we classify various transparent electrodes according to their Rsh and optical absorptance using the following methodology: a) The optical absorptance of different electrodes is compared instead of the transmittance. The reason for this is that the often-used optical transmittance is strongly linked to the reflectance of the transparent electrode, which, in turn, is strongly influenced by the optical properties of the substrate, the film thickness, and the surface texture. In addition, while the transmittance is normally measured on a flat glass substrate, several solar cell absorbers feature textured surfaces (e.g., silicon heterojunction solar cells[1]) or randomly oriented grains (e.g., CIGS and CZTS[107]), which increase the roughness of the films and influence the reflectance of the layered stacks. To make an accurate and fair comparison of the amount of light that is parasitically absorbed by a transparent electrode, independent of the substrate and surface roughness, we therefore use the absorptance (A) value, defined as A = 1 – TT – TR, where TT is the total transmittance and TR is the total reflectance. b) The spectrally weighted absorptance (Aweighted,x, where x is the solar cell or OLED) of the electrodes is compared rather than the absorptance at a single wavelength. The spectrally weighted absorptance takes into account the relevant wavelength range and the intensity of the light source that is absorbed or emitted by the device. This is expressed by d d weighted, light, light, 1, 2, 1 2 A I A I x x x x x ∫ ∫ λ λ λ λ ( ) ( ) = λ λ λ λ (3) where A(λ) is the absorptance of the transparent electrode as a function of wavelength, Ilight,x is the intensity of the light source spectrum, and λ1,x and λ2,x are the wavelength’s range as defined by the application. In solar cells, Ilight,solar is the 1 sun air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar spectrum. The wavelength range (λ1 to λ2) depends on the type of solar cell. Here, we use the wavelength range from λ1 = 320 to λ2 = 1200 nm (Figure 2a), which covers the range of most of the solar cells analyzed here. In OLEDs, Ilight,OLED is the emission spectrum of a white OLED in the wavelength range from λ1 = 380 to λ2 = 780 nm (Figure 3a).

KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (8 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT sensitivity spectrum (Figure 3b) should also be taken into account. c) To compare different transparent electrodes, we use the following figure of merit (FOM): FOM 1 weighted, sh A R x = (4) As a result, high-quality transparent electrodes are characterized by high FOM values. d) Finally, with the exception of graphene, we compare transparent electrodes only for which transmittance and reflectance data have been reported. 4.1. Transparent Electrodes as Front Contacts in Solar Cells Figure 2 shows the standardized terrestrial solar irradiance spectrum (AM1.5) under 1 sun intensity (a) and the external quantum efficiencies (QE) (left axis, b) for a range of archetypical high-efficiency solar cells that employ transparent electrodes, namely perovskite, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and perovskite-SHJ tandem solar cells. The absorptance curves of various transparent electrodes are presented in Figure 2b (right axis). Figure 2b shows that the front transparent electrode in any solar cell should have a sufficiently large (>3 eV) optical band gap to avoid absorption losses in the visible range of the spectrum. This requirement is already fulfilled by several TCOs.[23] For example, the optical band gap (Eg) of sputtered ITO, IZO and IO:H films are between 3.5 and 3.8 eV.[111] Transparent electrodes with low absorptance in the NIR-IR part of the spectrum (transparent electrodes with low FCA) are required for CIGS, SHJ and multi-junction devices, such as perovskite-onsilicon[109,112] and perovskite-on-CIGS[113] tandem solar cells, as these devices employ optical absorbers that are active in this range of the spectrum. These tandem approaches are new highefficiency photovoltaic technologies, with a potential to reach about 30% efficiency,[114,115] clearly underscoring the critical importance and urgency of designing transparent electrodes with exceptionally large broadband transparency. By comparing the absorptance curves of the TCOs in Figure 2b, we observe that hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H)[116] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 2. a) AM1.5G 1 sun irradiance spectra and b) quantum efficiency of a perovskite,[108] CdTe,[95] CIGS,[95] perovskite-SHJ tandem,[109] and SHJ[110] solar cells as a function of wavelength.

All transparent electrodes were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C to match the thermal budget of the solar cells. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (9 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT and cerium/hydrogen or tungsten/hydrogen co-doped In2O3 (ICO:H, IWO:H, respectively)[117] offer the best optical properties, with an absorptance below 2% from 400 up to 1200 nm. Another notable TCO with minimal absorptance in the NIR-IR range is doped CdO[52] (not shown here). These TCOs have an excellent optical-electrical trade-off, potentially from their exceptionally high electron mobilities, on the order of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, combined with their relatively low free carrier densities. More specifically, in the case of IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H, the free carrier densities are usually below 3 × 1020 cm−3. Their electron mobilities are about 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IO:H and IWO:H and 140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ICO:H, resulting in Rsh in the range of 30–40 Ω sq−1 (Figure 2c), which are excellent values for high-efficiency solar cell applications. The high free electron mobilities in these polycrystalline hydrogenated In2O3-based materials are explained by the formation of large grains, together with possible grain-boundary passivation by hydrogen, as well as the fact that H atoms in the film do not contribute significantly to ionized or neutral impurity scattering.[118,119] IO:H, ICO:H, and IWO:H have been successfully applied in SHJ,[117,120–122] CIGS,[123] and perovskite solar cells.[124] Amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) is another TCO with low FCA and good electrical properties. Even with an amorphous structure (different from polycrystalline IO:H and ICO:H), IZO can have electron mobilities up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 for free carrier densities between 1–3 × 1020 cm−3.[111,125,126] An attractive feature of these TCOs is that they already have excellent optoelectronic properties in their as-deposited state; these properties are not much affected by post-deposition annealing and offer opportunities for temperature-sensitive applications. A possible drawback is their relatively high absorption in the UV-vis range due to optical band gap narrowing.[111] This is a common effect in amorphous materials caused by exponential subgap tails due to disorder (also called Urbach tails)[127,128] and the presence of defects that introduce subgap absorption centers.[129] The application of IZO in solar cells has been demonstrated in SHJ[111] and perovskite solar cells.[130] A particularly attractive feature of all indium-oxide-based electrodes (including ITO) is the fact that their refractive index is close to 2. This is approximately the geometric mean of the refractive indices of air and typical solar cell absorbers (such as silicon), which gives these materials very good anti-reflective coating (ARC) properties.

Regardless of the thickness, BZO maintains its excellent optical properties for two reasons: low free carrier densities (in the order of 1019 cm−3) and a particular increase of electron mobility with increasing film thickness (due to its pyramidal shaped grains).[134,135] Electron mobilities up to 58 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in BZO films post-treated with H2 plasma.[136] The red curve in Figure 2b shows the absorptance of a BZO electrode with 10 Ω sq−1 Rsh. This very low Rsh is achieved by increasing the thickness of the film by 1 to 5 µm. Given the required thickness to obtain sufficiently conductive films, BZO films are not used as antireflective coatings. However, due to their self-texturing tendency during CVD, they offer excellent light-trapping conditions for thin-film photovoltaics, as evidenced by their successful application in thin-film silicon[137,138] and CIGS solar cells.[139] The absorptances of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) with 30 Ω sq−1111 and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with 15 Ω sq−1140 are already much higher than those of IO:H, IWO:H, ICO:H, IZO, and BZO. The high parasitic absorption in the NIR range of these materials originates from their high free carrier densities, required because their electron mobilities are lower than 40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Current losses linked to parasitic absorption in the front ITO in SHJ cells or in the front FTO in perovskiteSHJ tandem cells have been analyzed in ref. [140] and ref. [141], respectively. The popularity of both TCOs for application as window layers in solar cells is partly due to their chemical and environmental stability, as well as their demonstrated largescale production.[142,143] It is important to note that while IO:H and ICO:H are excellent electrodes for photovoltaic cells, they are still relatively new materials and their fabrication at production-relevant scales is yet to be demonstrated. One of the challenges for upscaling hydrogenated indium oxides is to control the introduction of water molecules during deposition (to include the H dopants). Approaches such as the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) would be, for example, a controlled way to grow high mobility IO:H.[118] With the obvious efforts to replace ITO with high-mobility TCOs, we expect the development of industry-relevant techniques for their fabrication. Aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes have also been widely used in PV devices.[144–146] AZO, like BZO, is attractive due to its non-toxicity and the abundance of Zn in the Earth’s crust. The low FOM value compared to, e.g., BZO, is due to the higher FCA in AZO. AZO is polycrystalline, with a columnar-like structure, forming grain boundaries that limit its mobility (typically on the order of 10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1). Postthermal treatments are known to improve the resistivity of AZO by increasing its free carrier density.[147] The electron mobility of sputtered AZO has been successfully increased up to 40–67 cm2 V−1 s−1 by incorporating a capping layer and applying a high-temperature (650°C) annealing step.[148] Considering the temperature restriction of several devices, low Rsh values are therefore mainly achieved by increasing Ne, at the cost of an inflated FCA. Although the FOM values for sputtered and chemical-bath-deposited (CBD) AZO are similar, deposition from solution presents some advantages: it is a simple and low-cost process,[149] and it is gentle, preventing physical damage to the substrates or active device layers where the material is deposited. Next to CBD, ALD and CVD are gentle deposition techniques as well and used for fabrication of several of the transparent electrodes discussed here. The ITO/Ag/AZO layer stack suffers the highest absorptance, from 500 to 800 nm, of all the curves compared. This is related to large reflectance and absorption losses in the thin metal film that provides the very low Rsh values. The shown absorptance is from[150]; however, approaches to improve the optical properties, e.g., by oxidizing the intermediate Ag film, have been demonstrated in subsequent reports.[151] While these films are not optimal for high efficiency solar cells, the possibility of sputtering these layers at room temperature, the limited total thickness of the trilayer-stack (<100 nm) and the ductility of the intermediate metal layer, with a thickness between 8 and 12 nm, make these electrodes interesting for flexible optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the high reflectance of these layers has been used to create a resonant optical cavity to trap the light in organic solar cells and, as a consequence, to increase their quantum efficiencies.[152] A summary of the approaches to optimize these types of dielectric/metal/dielectric layers for application in organic photovoltaic devices is found in ref. [153]. Finally, the absorptance curve of a monolayer of graphene, as reported in ref. [41], indicates that the use of such a material can be beneficial for applications in the NIR-IR range. However, in the visible range, the absorptance is already much higher than several of the other shown transparent electrodes. This is also reflected by the fact that a realistic Rsh value of 1000 Ω sq−1154 results in the lowest solar-cell FOM of all transparent electrodes, as shown in Figure 2d, casting doubt on whether monolayer graphene will ever find applications in highly efficient solar cells. As noted earlier, doping approaches and multilayers of graphene reduce the Rsh to more device-relevant values, but this is at the expense of increased absorptance.[41] Figure 2c shows normalized weighted absorptance as a function of Rsh for the various transparent electrodes compared here. Dashed lines of constant FOM are given for reference. These dashed lines highlight the observation that FOM converges for cases of very large Rsh values with very low absorptance or vice versa. Therefore, in Figure 2c we restricted the comparison of FOM values for transparent electrodes to a maximum of Rsh = 100 Ω sq−1, which is a relevant value for applications in photovoltaic devices. Figure 2d compares the FOM of transparent electrodes classified by thickness. The electrodes are sorted from left to right with the thickest electrodes, poorly suited for flexible applications on the left, and thinner electrodes, which present higher resistance to mechanical bending and stretching, on the right.[18] Note that Figure 2 considers a very general case by using only the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum under a 1 Sun intensity to evaluate transparent electrodes for any solar cell. To calculate the FOM for a specific solar cell, Equation (3) can be modified to include the quantum efficiency of the device: www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron.

Transparent Electrodes as Front Electrodes in OLEDs To evaluate FOM of transparent electrodes geared towards applications in OLEDs (a similar case would apply for bottomemitting LEDs), we use a white OLED spectrum simulated with SETFOS.[155] Figure 3 shows the white OLED spectrum used as Ilight (λ) in Equation (4) to evaluate the weighted absorptance of transparent electrodes. Contrary to solar cells, applications in LEDs, or OLEDs for lighting, displays or touch screens feature a narrower wavelength range at which the transparent electrode should have minimum absorptance, relaxing the optical requirements as compared with solar cells. In fact, effects such as the Burstein-Moss shift or FCA in TCOs have only a minimal influence on the parasitic absorption for these applications. Nevertheless, we can observe in Figure 3b that the absorptance of the TCOs still follows a similar trend as in Figure 2b,c, with ZnO:B, ICO:H, and IWO:H the transparent electrodes with the lowest absorptance and highest conductivity, and therefore exhibiting the highest FOMs. In this comparison, we have also included the case of a zinc tin oxide (ZTO) combined with metal grids embedded on a polymer matrix.[156] ZTO is an amorphous TCO, with sufficient conductivity to be utilized in combination with metal grids as the anode in large-area flexible OLEDs. In fact, it was demonstrated that with the same type of metal grids, ZTO devices performed better than the reference ITO OLEDs.[157] As observed in Figure 3c, the combination of the exceptionally low absorptance and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1 for ZnO:B, or even a lower Rsh (1 Ω sq−1) provided by the metal grids in the case of the hybrid ZTO + metal grid electrode, gives the highest FOM to these two transparent electrodes. The large thickness of ZnO:B, required to achieve low Rsh values, may prevent its application in flexible devices, however, as indicated in Figure 3d. For such applications, hybrid electrodes based on ZTO and metal grids may offer a better alternative.[156] However, in rigid top-emitting LEDs, ZnO:B, when grown by LPCVD, has the additional advantage of an intrinsic pyramidal surface texture with known light scattering properties,[137] improving light out coupling.[158] TCO/metal/TCO stacks and Ag NWs are on par in our FOM comparison. Although neither features simultaneously optimal Rsh and absorptance, these transparent electrodes offer properties that are interesting for flexible devices. For our comparison, we use representative absorptance and Rsh data of Ag NWs taken from the current literature.[8,95,159,160] However, we note that intensive research efforts are ongoing on Ag NWs, promising further performance improvements. Such improvements will mainly be achieved by increased fabrication control and deposition of metal grids with submicron-width lines,[161] development of hybrid approaches to improve stability under corrosive and oxidation conditions, as well as improved adhesion to the substrates. A monolayer of graphene with a sheet resistivity of 1000 Ω sq−1 gives, by far, the lowest FOM for photovoltaics. We note that for the case of OLEDs, the FOM is reaching a comparable value relative to other transparent electrodes in the list. This is because the absorptance values of the various transparent electrodes are comparably low in the relevant wavelength range for these devices (the visible light spectrum). Nevertheless, the 1000 Ω sq−1 Rsh associated with a monolayer of graphene raises the concern of high resistive losses when applied in devices. Hybrid approaches offer help in such cases. As an example, several laboratory-scale OLEDs and LEDs have used graphene-based electrodes, i.e., hybrid nanowires and graphene, conductive polymer and graphene and graphene oxide layers.[35,162] However, only a few groups have demonstrated the use of a single layer of graphene as the anode in small-area OLED devices.[163] 5. Other Specific Requirements of Transparent Electrodes for Solar Cells and OLEDs 5.1. Fabrication Compatibility As listed in Table 1, fabrication compatibility, i.e., processing temperature, chemical inertness, and non-damaging methods, is also an important selection criterion for transparent electrodes to be used in specific devices. For example, the thermal budget of OLEDs, SHJ, CIGS, CdTe, and perovskite-based solar cells is below 200 °C.[164,165] Clearly, fabrication of transparent electrodes on plastic flexible substrates also requires strict fabrication temperatures below approximately 150 °C. In this context, all electrodes depicted in Figure 2 and 3 were fabricated at temperatures lower than 200 °C, during both deposition and post-deposition annealing (when applicable). The only exception is FTO, which is normally deposited or post-treated at temperatures well above 200 °C.[166–168] Amorphous TCOs such as IZO, offer the greatest flexibility, as they can be deposited nominally at room temperature and do not require post-deposition annealing. Such TCOs have demonstrated their value in SHJ and perovskite solar cell fabrication.[111,130] As mentioned earlier, gentle deposition on underlying layers can also be a critical factor in electrode choice and raises questions about the use of well-established physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition for certain applications. Sputter damage, caused by UV radiation and particle bombardment, is a known phenomenon in organic,[16] SHJ,[15] and perovskite[169] solar cells as well as flexible displays. Solutions to overcome such damage include the use of remote plasma sources,[170] the use of gently deposited buffer layers[171] or further improvements to solution-based deposition processes to improve the density and purity of TCO films to achieve high electron mobilities at low temperatures.[45,172] 5.2. Interfaces with the Transparent Electrodes Good electrical and chemical matching at the interface between transparent electrodes and their adjacent layers in a device is another criterion for electrode selection and optimization. This interface can be shared with the carrier-collection or carrier-injection layers, but also with the metal grid of the device. www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1600529 (12 of 17) wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT Large-area optoelectronic devices often require a metal grid, which is normally deposited on the transparent electrode, to minimize the lateral resistance and, thus, voltage loss over large areas. As an example, we present a sketch of a cross section of a SHJ solar cell in Figure 4 to highlight the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)/TCO/metal interfaces with the corresponding band diagram. Transversely, minimizing electrical losses is equally important. Again, in SHJ solar cells, the main contributors to such transverse resistance are the contact resistances (ρc) at the metal/TCO interface (label 1 in Figure 4b) and, even more so, at the TCO/a-Si:H interface (label 3 in Figure 4b); the intrinsic resistance of the TCO in the transverse direction (label 2 in Figure 4b) is usually sufficiently low to be neglected. Across the metal/TCO interface, the dominant carrier transport mechanism is field emission, for which the contact resistivity (ρc) is expressed as exp with E = 4 field emission c B * 0 E qh N m e ρ φ π ε ε ( ) ∝     ∞ (6) where φB is the barrier height and E is the tunneling energy.[174] This equation makes evident the improvement in ρc from the increased carrier density, Ne, of the transparent electrode, which suggests the use of bilayer TCOs that feature high surface but low bulk Ne to minimize ρc and FCA simultaneously.[121] Practically, the TCO/metal contact resistance is commonly characterized by the transfer length method (TLM).[175] In terms of metallization, screen-printed, low-temperature Ag pastes are commonly used, especially in industry. In such a case, ρc values on the order of 10−5 Ω cm[2] are typical, as is the case of the ITO/Ag and a-IZO/Ag interfaces, commonly used in solar cells.[111,176] Electroplated Cu can offer advantages in terms of line resistivity and material cost compared with printed Ag electrodes. However, due to the ease of diffusing electroplated Cu into silicon, where it can act as a carrier lifetime killer, its application to photovoltaics is not evident. Interestingly, ITO forms an excellent Cu diffusion barrier. The low measuredρc value for the Cu/ITO interface (ρc < 10−4 cm−3) validates this combination for high-efficiency silicon solar cells.[176] Contrary to the case of TCOs, achievement of sufficiently low ρc between the metal and Ag NWs or graphene electrodes is still an unresolved challenge.[100] To extract or inject carriers efficiently in solar cells or OLEDs, respectively, the interface between the transparent electrode and the active layer of the device (absorber or emitter) should have a negligible contact resistance (ρc) as well.[177] A main cause of this resistance is the combined effect of Fermi-level pinning at the interface and work function mismatch between adjacent materials.[177] This causes the formation of an interfacial energy barrier, characterized by a certain height and depletion width penetrating both materials. Such barriers can in principle be overcome by thermionic (field) emission, evidenced by lowered ρc values with increasing operating temperatures.[178] The barrier width can also be narrowed by increasing surface doping to increase field emission across the interface, similar to the metal/TCO case. As an alternative to doping, the work function of TCOs can be modified by surface treatments (UV, ozone, oxygen plasma),[179] or by the application of specific interfacial buffer layers with optimized work functions. The work function and band alignment of various TCOs for selected devices have been studied by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).[11,12,180] A selected list of TCOs and metals with their respective work function values as reported in literature is found in the Supporting Information (Table S2). In metal NWs and graphene electrodes, the work function cannot be intrinsically modified; however, a common approach is the application of a capping layer or creating hybrid electrodes with high or low work function polymers[177] or metal oxide films.[181,182] www.advelectronicmat.de Adv. Electron. Mater. 2017, 1600529 www.advancedsciencenews.com Figure 4. a) Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell structure and b) zoom-in of the front TCO layer indicating the 1. metal/TCO interface, 2. bulk and 3.

In either case, collected carriers need to overcome in principle several barriers, namely at the c-Si/a-Si:H, the a-Si:H/TCO, and the TCO/metal interface (not drawn). The first barrier is caused by band offsets. The second one can be caused by Fermi-level pinning at the interface and insufficient doping of a-Si:H and TCO. Because the TCO is normally n-type, an Ohmic contact for electrons is in principle guaranteed on the rear side. Transport at the TCO(n)/a-Si:H(p) interface occurs by band-to-band tunneling with photogenerated holes efficiently recombining with electrons from the TCO.[173] © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim (13 of 17) 1600529 wileyonlinelibrary.com PROGRESS REPORT 5.3. Stability Under Thermal and Humid Environments Environmental stability of transparent electrodes is also of critical importance when integrating them in devices. Damp heat tests performed under standard conditions of 85% humidity at 85°C for prolonged time (1000 h) were used to demonstrate the high environmental stability of ITO and IZO electrodes.[183] IO:H and AZO, on the contrary, showed poorer electrical stability under damp heat conditions mainly due to the introduction of water at grain boundaries.[183,184] In the case of IO:H it has been recently demonstrated that damp heat degradation is strongly linked to the hydrogen content in the films. IO:H films with hydrogen content lower than 5 at.% exhibit stable electrical properties after exposure to DH conditions.[185] The application of capping layers, e.g., capping IO:H with a very thin and dense layer of ITO, improves the environmental stability of the electrodes.[183] In terms of thermal stability, full-device fabrication might require temperature steps that could modify the carrier density or microstructure in TCOs, degrading the optoelectronic properties. TCOs with good temperature stability are mainly multicompound amorphous materials, such as IZO and ZTO.[125,186] In nanowire networks, clustering of the network due to a temperature step would increase the roughness of the electrode and induce the formation of shorts in e.g. organic devices. In addition to temperature, UV exposure may also detrimentally affect some transparent electrodes. Conductive polymers used in organic devices and hybrid electrodes, such as nanowire-based and metal grids embedded in a conductive polymer, yellow with exposure to UV and temperature.[187] In terms of chemical stability, cleaning of the substrate before OLED or perovskite cell deposition can cause damage to the transparent electrodes. SnO2, ITO, and a-ZnSnO are among the TCOs with the highest chemical stabilities[146] and therefore are fully compatible with industry-based processes to fabricate, e.g., OLED devices.[157] 6. Perspectives The continuous drive to increase solar cell efficiency, as well as the push for improved performance of several other optoelectronic devices, requires the development of transparent electrodes with next-generation requirements, including ultrahigh broadband transparency, high conductivity, adaptability, and composition mainly from abundant elements. The best example of a device that requires premium broadband transparent electrodes on its front is the perovskite-silicon multi-junction solar cell, which, as indicated in Figure 2, aims at active absorption of the broadest photon-energy range. The electrodes in this type of solar cell need to feature a wide band gap, low FCA, and relatively low sheet resistivity. In addition, they should be deposited without damaging the carrier-selective contacts in the silicon cell, or the perovskite layers, and cannot be annealed. The best solution for this is a very high mobility TCO, deposited at room-temperature using a gentle deposition technique. Amorphous indium-based TCOs are the best candidates; however, widening of their band gap remains a challenge. Further exploration of materials to find the right dopants or compounds that open up the band gap or of new material systems with tuned compositions and microstructures is just one path to the discovery of amorphous low-temperature and gently-deposited high mobility broadband transparent electrodes. In terms of deposition, further development of high-end deposition techniques, such as ALD, low-temperature solution-based deposition processes, or new PVD system designs that avoid the direct exposure of the substrate to the plasma during deposition (e.g., high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation,[188,189] or facing target sputtering[190]), is just one path to the development of ultra-high performance TCOs and TCOs/ device interfaces. Material design is also expected to play a decisive role in the development of Earth-abundant transparent electrodes, as well as for the discovery of high-performance transparent and conductive materials especially with p-type conductivity. Much is expected from high-throughput screenings using the combination of computational and experimental methods, looking for new design principles and experimenting with various synthesis approaches. On the p-type TCO side, recent investigations of metal-based oxysulfides or non-oxide chalcogenides (S, Se, Te) or pnictides (N, P) as potential p-type transparent conducting candidates show promise in reducing the hole effective mass and to increase conductivity. Recent progress on sulfide-based p-type transparent conductors has enabled device demonstrations that employ p-type transparent contacts. For example, low-temperature synthesized Cu-Zn-S has been applied as a hole-selective contact in solar cells with n-type absorbers.[81] The scalability and low processing temperature of these p-type transparent conductors merits further material and device exploration. Aside from transparency and conductivity, other specific properties (stretchability, self-healing, antibacterial properties) of transparent electrodes are becoming increasingly important as they are being implemented into thin, lightweight and wearable devices that require both ease-of-use and robustness. Examples of these are fiber-like electrodes,[191,192] consisting of fully integrated conductive fibers with a transparent matrix or skin-integrated circuits and optoelectronics that require transparent electrodes fabricated with non-toxic and biocompatible materials. The combination of optoelectronic and environmental or mechanical requirements is in many cases best achieved by hybrid approaches that integrate polymers and high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Lastly, in addition to the three different approaches to create transparent electrodes presented earlier in the manuscript, a largely unexplored area is the use of photonic crystals and metamaterials. In this case, light management through structures with metallic conductivity could simultaneously provide transparency and charge transport, creating transparent conductive structures.

High-mobility TCOs are needed to achieve high conductivity with improved visible and near-infrared transparency; however, the fabrication of TCO films on heat-sensitive layers or substrates is constrained by the trade-off between fabrication temperatures and TCO properties. Historically, Sn-doped indium oxide and amorphous In– Zn–O have been used as standard TCOs to achieve high mobility using low fabrication temperatures. However, two polycrystalline In2O3 films with significantly higher mobilities have recently been reported: i) polycrystalline (poly-) In2O3 films doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibit mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures and ii) solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) and In2O3:Ce,H films exhibit mobilities greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 when processed at low temperatures of 150–200 C. Here, poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films are fabricated. Comparative studies of these films reveal the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties. 1. Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms have been widely used as window electrodes in optoelectronic applications such as displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The continuous development of solar cells (e.g., thin-ﬁlm Si, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and Si-wafer-based heterojunction solar cells) has stimulated research on TCO ﬁlms (e.g., In2O3,[1–6] ZnO,[1,7–10] and SnO2 [11]). For example, high electron mobility is required for the TCO ﬁlms used in solar cells because a high-mobility results in a low sheet resistance at a low carrier density, providing high transparency with reduced free-carrier absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.[12–16] Low-temperature growth is also required because of the presence of temperature-sensitive layers in many solar cells (e.g., Si heterojunction,[17,18] Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2,[19,20] and perovskite[21,22] solar cells). Polycrystalline (poly-) Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)[23–25] and amorphous-In2O3-based TCOs (e.g., a-ITO[25,26] and a-In–Zn–O (a-IZO)[27,28]) have been broadly used to satisfy these requirements. Poly-ITO ﬁlms grown at temperatures below 200–300 C exhibit a high electron mobility (μ) of 40 cm2 V1 s1 with a low resistivity (ρ) of 1 104Ω cm,[29] whereas a-IZO ﬁlms deposited even at room temperature exhibit a high μ of 60 cm2 V1 s1 with a relatively low ρ of 3 104Ω cm.[30,31] Recently, two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with higher μ values have been reported. First, poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti,[1,32] Zr,[1,33,34] Mo,[1,35–39] or W[5,40]) impurities (In2O3:Me) instead of Sn exhibit μ values greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 at a carrier density (N) from 1 1020 to 3 1020 cm3. These ﬁlms are normally deposited onto heated substrates using various growth methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and ion plating with DC arc discharge, known as high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation or reactive plasma deposition (RPD)). Second, solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) ﬁlms exhibit μ values greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 with N values from 1 1020 to 2 1020 cm3 at low process temperatures from 150 to 200 C.[41] The ﬁlms are fabricated using a two-step growth process, speciﬁcally, the deposition of amorphous or amorphous-rich In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low temperatures via magnetron sputtering,[41] RPD,[42] or atomic layer deposition[43] and subsequently thermally annealed at a temperature greater than 150 C. During annealing, solid-phase crystallization occurs and high electron mobility is achieved. Similar properties have also been reported for CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 ﬁlms.[42] Notably, spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms on glass substrates fabricated at low process temperatures (200 C) exhibited higher μ values than Medoped epitaxial ﬁlms grown at high temperatures (600 C) on single-crystalline oxide substrates.[15,44,45] The mechanisms responsible for this high electron mobility have been investigated. Analysis of effective mass has been conducted as a function of N for various specimens, including Dr. T. Koida, Y. Ueno, Dr. H.

KGaA, Weinheim 1700506 (1 of 14) polycrystalline and epitaxial ﬁlms and bulk single crystals, to determine the curvature of the energy band as a function of the Fermi energy.[38,40,46–50] High-μ TCO ﬁlms exhibited an electron effective mass similar to those of conventional poly-ITO and aIn2O3-based TCO ﬁlms, indicating that high μ is achieved through a larger relaxation time rather than a smaller effective mass.[47,49] In polycrystalline ﬁlms, the overall relaxation time is determined by scattering induced by grain boundaries (GBs), stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including neutral and ionized impurities, and phonons.[51,52] The effect of GB scattering can be evaluated from the ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility: Hall mobilities are affected by GB scattering when electrons transport across GBs, whereas optical mobilities are not affected by GBs because free electrons exist inside grains and because the amplitude of oscillation of an electron under the inﬂuence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the grain sizes in typical TCO ﬁlms.[13] In the spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms, the effect of GBs was found to be minor because these ﬁlms’ optical mobilities were comparable to their Hall mobilities.[47] Furthermore, the effects of dopant species (Me and H) on the grain-barrier height and resulting transport properties in polycrystalline ﬁlms have also been discussed.[53] With respect to intragrain properties, suppressed scattering from oxygen interstitials[36,39,40] originating from the formation of the singly charged donor (e.g., MoIn •••Oi00, WIn •••Oi00) and suppressed scattering from defects related to oxygen deﬁciencies[34,42,44,54] originating from the introduction of metals with higher bond strength with O than In and Sn in the In2O3 host material have been discussed. In In2O3:H ﬁlms, ab initio calculations revealed that interstitial H (Hi •) and substitutional H (HO •) function as singly charged donors, being energetically more favorable than an oxygen vacancy (VO ••).[55] Additionally, interstitial hydrogen atoms have been reported to passivate negatively charged acceptor-type cation vacancies.[56] Experimentally determined N and μ data have been evaluated on the basis of theoretical carrier scattering models and used to determine the doping mechanisms. The Hall mobility values agreed well with the calculated values dominated by singly charged impurities, which suggests that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, Hi •, HO •) rather than by doubly charged donors (e.g., VO ••) in In2O3:Me,[32,34,44] In2O3:H,[41] and In2O3:Ce,H.[42] However, the degenerately doped TCO ﬁlms exhibited higher electron mobility with constant N at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, indicating that the μ values measured at room temperature were limited not only by the ionized impurity scattering but also by phonon scattering.[34,41] Therefore, the good agreement of the values suggests imperfections of the modeled mobility. An extended model based on scatterings produced by phonon and ionized impurities has also been discussed.[49] Currently, the model cannot quantitatively explain the experimentally determined high μ values, especially at N values greater than 1 1019 cm3; however, a more in-depth understanding of acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering in these materials was achieved.[49,53,57] In this study, to clarify the commonalities and disparities between the two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with high μ, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms in the as-deposited state and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms and evaluated their structural, electrical, and optical properties. All of the ﬁlms were deposited using an RPD system, and the deposition conditions were ﬁxed as much as possible (except for variables such as the dopant species and concentrations, substrate temperatures, and H2O vapor pressures during growth) to minimize ﬂuctuations in ﬁlm properties as a consequence of changes in the experimental conditions. Comparative studies of these ﬁlms revealed the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resulting transport properties. Among the fabricated ﬁlms, the spc-In2O3:Ce,H exhibited the lowest ρ of 1.81 104 Ω cm with a μ of 154 cm2 V1 s1 and N of 2.24 1020 cm3. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Properties Table 1 summarizes the ratios of metal (W and Ce) to In determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the as-deposited In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms without substrate heating. In this analysis, the Cu and Mo impurity contents resulting from the RPD system were also measured to investigate their effect on the ﬁlms. The Cu, Mo, and Ce (W) concentrations in the In2O3:W,H (In2O3:Ce,H) ﬁlm were less than the lower detection limits (0.0036 at.% for Cu/In, 0.0024 at. % for Mo/In, 0.0016 at.% for Ce/In, and 0.0012 at.% for W/In) of the instrument. The W-to-In atomic ratio was 0.39 at.% in the In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, and the Ce-to-In ratios were 0.28, 0.96, and 1.3 at.% in the In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt. %) ﬁlms, respectively. Herein, we applied the same ratios in the post-annealed ﬁlms and the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C because tungsten oxides and cerium oxides did not effuse from the ﬁlms during annealing at 250 C, and the sticking coefﬁcients of W and Ce would not change signiﬁcantly at a substrate temperature of 200 C. Figure 1 plots the H contents in the ﬁlms as a function of the partial pressure of H2O (PH2O). The H contents systematically increased with increasing PH2O in the ﬁlms without substrate heating, whereas the values were below 0.5 at.% for the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The high PH2O of 2 104 to 3 104 Pa before the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me depositions originated from the degassing of H2O vapor from the areas around the heater in the RPD chamber. The large difference in H contents between Table 1.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis revealed that 10% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms deposited without substrate heating effused at temperatures as high as 250 C (not shown here), which is similar to the case of a-In2O3:H ﬁlms fabricated using magnetron sputtering.[47] Therefore, the H contents in the crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C did not substantially decrease compared with those in the as-deposited ﬁlms.[41,47] The same result was observed for the In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms; 9% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms effused at temperatures as high as 200 C, the growth temperature of the ﬁlms, indicating that most of the effusion originated from the bulk of the ﬁlms and not from adsorbates at the surface exposed to the atmosphere before the TDS characterization. Figure 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O. All of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited grain sizes of 50 nm. Conversely, all of the as-deposited In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms without substrate heating exhibited featureless structures with smooth surfaces because of the amorphous-phase formation (not shown here). After the post-annealing treatment at 250 C, the ﬁlms exhibited large grain structures. The grain size and shape were dependent on PH2O during deposition: the spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O exhibited only polygonal structures with larger grain sizes than the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, whereas the spcIn2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents deposited at low PH2O and all of the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O exhibited polygonal and ﬂower-like structures with substantially larger grains. Figure 3 presents the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the (a) glass substrate and poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and the as-deposited and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms deposited at PH2O of (b) 2 105 Pa and (c) 5 105 Pa. The XRD patterns do not show evidence of segregation of the tungsten oxides and cerium oxides in the In2O3:Me and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation of the <111> direction (Figure 3(a)). However, an increase in PH2O during deposition without substrate heating suppressed crystal growth. The as-deposited ﬁlms deposited at low PH2O (2 105 Pa) exhibited a very small 222 reﬂection with a broad peak originating from the amorphous structure (Figure 3(b)), whereas the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (5 105 Pa) exhibited amorphous structures without any diffraction peaks (Figure 3 (c)). After the post-annealing process, a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction was observed, especially for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)), indicating that small grains oriented in the <111> direction in the as-deposited ﬁlms acted as crystalline nuclei during the crystallization process. By contrast, a more randomly oriented structure was observed for the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high CeO2 contents (2 and 3 wt.%) deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)) and for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (Figure 3(c)). Figure 3 (d) plots d values of the 444 reﬂection (d444) for the ﬁlms shown in Figure 3(a)–(c). The d444 values of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms were larger than that of the In2O3 powders (d444 ¼ 0.1460 nm), indicating the formation of in-plane compressive strains in the ﬁlms. By contrast, those of the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H were nearly identical to that of the In2O3 powder, reﬂecting lessstrained ﬁlms. Furthermore, the crystallized ﬁlms exhibited smaller full-width at half-maximum values of the 222 reﬂection than the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C, indicating larger crystallite sizes and smaller strains in the ﬁlms. Notably, the large differences between the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms do not originate from the slight difference in fabrication temperatures (i.e., 200 C for the polycrystalline ﬁlms and 250 C for the solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms) but from the different ﬁlm-preparation methods.

Figure 4 presents (a) image quality maps and inverse pole ﬁgure maps along the (b) normal, (c) transverse, and (d) reference directions for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms deposited at (1) low and (2) high PH2O. Here, the image quality map shows the GB and strain contrast. As observed in Figure 4(b-1, c-1, d-1), most of the grains in the ﬁlm fabricated at low PH2O were oriented in the <111> direction normal to the surface with the <101> direction parallel to the surface. This result corresponds well to the θ–2θ pattern shown in Figure 3(b). In addition, a dark spot within each grain is observed in the image quality map (Figure 4(a-1)). The difference in contrast reﬂects the difference in crystalline quality, indicating that the dark spots correspond to the crystalline nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix, which were formed during deposition (Figure 3(b)). Hence, the map clearly suggests that the grain size (0.81 μm) of the post-annealed ﬁlm was determined by the density of the crystalline nuclei and that no new nuclei were formed during post-annealing. Conversely, the ﬁlm grown at high PH2O exhibited larger grain sizes Figure 2.

In contrast to Figure 4(a-1), Figure 4(a-2) shows no dark spots within the grains. In addition, the ﬁlm crystallized at higher temperatures than the ﬁlm grown at low PH2O, as will be explained in Section 2.2. Therefore, the formation of nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix would be well suppressed because of the high PH2O during deposition and crystalline nuclei would be formed during post-annealing. On the basis of these results, we discuss the crystal growth of these ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation in the <111> direction. Similar crystalline orientations have been observed in the XRD patterns of polyIn2O3 ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and without substrate heating at a very low PH2O of <5 106 Pa for ﬁlms prepared by magnetron sputtering.[41,45] Because the (111) surface energy is the lowest among the low-indexed surfaces in In2O3, including the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces,[58] the ﬁlms grown on glass would exhibit preferred orientation in the <111> direction. However, the introduction of larger amounts of Ce (CeO2: 2, 3 wt.%) and/ or H2O vapor prevented the preferred orientation (Figure 3(b) and (c)). According to crystal growth theory, a critical cluster size exists because of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the cluster to grow to become a nucleus. Therefore, the incorporation of Ce and H atoms or OH-related species at the growth front inﬂuences medium-range structures[59] in the amorphous ﬁlms with an increase in the barrier height, thereby leading to the formation of low-density nuclei with preferred orientation of the <111> direction and no nuclei within the amorphous matrix at low and high PH2O, respectively. Consequently, the post-annealed ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O exhibited a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction and random orientation, respectively. Here, in the latter ﬁlms, nucleation would be generated from nanoclusters with medium-range ordering and grow during post-annealing. The grain size of the ﬁlms deposited at high (low) PH2O was 5.5 μm (0.81 μm), which are far larger than that (0.44 μm) of the ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering.[47] This ﬁnding can be explained by the lower densities of crystalline nuclei in the Figure 3.

During heating, solid-phase crystallization occurred. In Figure 5(a), the as-deposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at high PH2O exhibited a constant N at temperatures below 180 C, indicating that the ﬁlm was a degenerately doped semiconductor. However, a large decrease in N combined with an increase in μ was clearly observed at 180–200 C. Previous XRD and SEM analyses for aIn2O3:H ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering revealed that crystallization proceeded at the temperatures at which the N and μ values varied.[47] Therefore, the change observed in Figure 5(a) originated from the increase in the volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the ﬁlm. Upon full crystallization, the ﬁlm exhibited a constant N at temperatures over the entire range and Figure 4.

In the asdeposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low PH2O, the change in N occurred at lower temperatures (130–150 C), which can be explained by the presence of abundant crystalline nuclei within the as-deposited ﬁlm described in Section 2.1, thereby leading to full crystallization at lower temperatures. This ﬁnding is also true for the a-In2O3:W,H and a-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with a small amount of Ce (Figure 5(b) and (c)). However, the temperature increased with increasing Ce content (Figure 5(c)–(e)): i.e., 160– 180 C (200–220 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, 180– 200 C (190–210 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 2 wt.%) ﬁlms, and 180–200 C (210–230 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low (high) PH2O. The Ce doping increased the crystallization temperature. As shown in Figure 5, all of the as-deposited ﬁlms exhibited higher N values when deposited at high PH2O. In general, the N of a-In2O3-based TCOs, including a-IZO, a-ITO, and a-In2O3:H, can be controlled by the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm.[59,61] Herein, only PH2O was varied; the O2 and Ar ﬂow rates were constant. Therefore, the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm increased with increasing PH2O because of the presence of H radicals and ions produced in the plasma during deposition. Here, we assume that the N values in the a-In2O3:H and a-In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms were basically determined by the oxygen stoichiometry Figure 5.

Figure 6(a) summarizes the ρ, N, and μ values as a function on the Me/In ratio for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solidphase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The dotted line in the middle panel of Figure 6(a) shows the expected N for which all the carriers are generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, WIn •••Oi00). As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), N of the amorphous ﬁlms did not increase with increasing Me/In ratio and instead decreased with increasing Ce/In ratio. The results clearly demonstrate that Me did not act as an electron donor in the amorphous phase and that Ce doping reduced the oxygen deﬁciency within the a-In2O3 matrix, likely because of the higher bond strength of Ce–O than In–O. Moreover, the μ values decreased with increasing Ce content, indicating that Ce atoms act as scattering centers for free electrons in the amorphous structure. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon crystallization of the In2O3:H layer, N decreased with a large increase in μ. In addition, the slope of mobility as a function of temperature increased after crystallization. These results suggest a change in the carrier generation and scattering mechanisms. In previous works, we proposed that structural rearrangements during crystallization eliminate oxygen-vacancy-type defects with a large scattering cross section and produce Hi • and/or HO •, which act as singly charged donors.[41,47] In In2O3:W,H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, decreases of N were observed at the crystallization temperatures. However, the magnitude of the decreases of N decreased with increasing Me contents. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), the N values of the crystallized In2O3:H ﬁlms were 1 1020–1.5 1020 cm3 because of the Hi • and/or HO • donors. As the Me content was increased to 0.39 at.%, the N values increased with a similar slope of the dotted line. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a gradual increase of the N values. These results demonstrate that W and Ce were activated as donors by the crystallization process even in the presence of hydrogen. By contrast, the N of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm deposited at 200 C was 3 1019 cm3. The free carriers are assumed to be generated from intrinsic defects, mainly from oxygen-vacancytype defects, as revealed in previous works.[34,44] When the ﬁlms were doped with low Me contents, the N values increased in Figure 6.

A further increase in the Ce/In ratio increased the N values although the values were below the dotted line. These results indicate that Wand Ce work as electron donors. The overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors. Notably, the H contents determined by TDS and hydrogen forward-scattering spectrometry (HFS) reveal that large amounts of hydrogen are present that do not contribute to the carrier generation. The hydrogen passivates acceptors[56] to reduce the carrier compensation because the In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited signiﬁcantly high μ, as described below. We here focus on the μ values of the ﬁlms. Figure 6(b) summarizes the relationship between N and μ measured at room temperature for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. At a glance, the μ values varied depending on the ﬁlm structure and fabrication processes: the a-In2O3:H and In2O3: Me,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 40–60 cm2 V1 s1, the polyIn2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 30–90 cm2 V1 s1 that strongly depended on Me, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce, H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 110–160 cm2 V1 s1, and the spcIn2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 80 cm2 V1 s1. In general, the mobility of polycrystalline TCO ﬁlms is dominated by scattering produced by GBs, stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including ionized and neutral impurities, and phonons.[51,52] To distinguish between the contributions of the various scattering sources, a comparison of the Hall and optical mobilities and measurements of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect are useful. The ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility reﬂects the effect of GB scattering: a ratio of 1 implies that GB scattering plays a negligible effect in the ﬁlms, whereas a ratio less than 1 implies that GB scattering inﬂuences the μ values, as explained in Section 1. When transport across GBs occurs mainly through thermionic emission instead of tunneling, the effect of GB scattering on the μ values increases with decreasing temperature.[51–53] This trend is also true for scattering induced by charged extended defects.[52] By contrast, scattering induced by ionized and neutral impurities is independent of temperature in a degenerately doped semiconductor, whereas phonon scattering becomes large with increasing temperature. From a previous analysis of spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms that exhibit transport properties similar to those shown in Figure 6, the Hall mobilities were equal to the optical mobilities,[47] suggesting that GB scattering plays a negligible effect and that intragrain properties limit the Hall mobilities in the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms. Figure 7 shows a plot of the data in Figure 5 for the spc-In2O3: H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms during the cooling process from 250 C to room temperature; the mobilities are plotted versus the corresponding carrier densities with temperature acting as parameter. The spc-In2O3:H and spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited i) a slight decrease in N with an increase in μ from 250 to 230 C and ii) a large increase in μ with a negligible change in N from 230 C to room temperature. The former result is explained by the desorption of H from the ﬁlms during heating under vacuum, whereas the latter result clearly suggests that phonon scattering dominates the ﬁlms’ μ values. The spcIn2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O and the spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O exhibited high μ values of 160 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature. The high μ values with N values of 1 1020–2 1020 cm3 cannot be quantitatively explained by the current models,[49] as described in Section 1. However, the μ values strongly suggest that scattering produced by neutral and doubly charged ionized impurities is negligible and that their mobilities are limited by singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •) and by phonon scattering.[49] Indeed, the dominant valence states of Ce have been reported to be 3þ and 4þ in In2O3:Ce,H and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms.[6] Conversely, the μ values for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O increased slowly with decreasing temperature and the ﬁlm exhibited lower μ values at room temperature than the ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O. Plausibly, charged extended and point defects within grains are present in the ﬁlm because of low H contents and/or H effusion from the ﬁlm during post-annealing. Indeed, decreases in both the Hall and the optical mobility were observed in spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms when the ﬁlms were postannealed at higher temperatures (400 C).[47] By contrast, the μ values of the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents increased and N decreased during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a large decrease of μ and a slight increase of N (Figure 6 and 7). These results imply that extensive Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) produced carrier scattering centers in addition to the singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •), leading to compensation of the free carriers, likely via the formation of defect complexes such as 2 CeIn •Oi00 in the ﬁlms. By contrast, spc-In2O3:W,H Figure 7. Variation of the carrier density (N) and mobility (μ) of spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films during cooling from 250 C to room temperature.

Because no large difference in the structure was detected between the spc-In2O3:W,H and spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms by XRD, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not shown here) analyses, the point defects within the grains that cannot be assessed by these characterization tools may be responsible for the low mobility. In addition, post-annealing of the poly-In2O3:W ﬁlm at 300 C increased the μ values to 110 cm2 V1 s1, much higher than the μ values of the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms, as will be shown later. The same post-annealing process was performed for the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms; however, the μ values of the ﬁlms did not increase (not shown here). Therefore, point defects associated with W and H or OH species may be responsible for the other scattering centers produced in the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms. With respect to the carrier scattering in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms, Figure 6(a) and (b) shows that the μ values of the polyIn2O3:Ce ﬁlms were much smaller than those of the corresponding spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms. To investigate the dominant scattering centers in the polycrystalline ﬁlms, we postannealed the ﬁlms at 300 C. The [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values varied from [1.7 1020, 82] to [1.7 1020, 110], from [1.1 1020, 70] to [1.1 1020, 96], from [1.5 1020, 81] to [1.5 1020, 100], and from [1.9 1020, 88] to [2.0 1020, 110] after the post-annealing process for the poly-In2O3:W, poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), poly-In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 2 wt.%), and poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. In all of the ﬁlms, μ values increased with a negligible change in N. The mobility improvement was not accompanied by a change of the structural properties, as revealed by XRD (not shown). Thus, no recrystallization occurred during the post-annealing process. However, the point and extended defect densities were plausibly reduced by the process. That is, the as-deposited poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms contained a large amount of point and extended defects because of the low-temperature deposition and their mobilities were limited largely by intragrain properties. Notably, a linear increase of μ values with increasing N in Figure 6(b) for the asdeposited poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms seems like a suggestion at a glance that the GB scattering strongly inﬂuences the μ values if we assume similar grain sizes and trap densities at GBs in the polycrystalline ﬁlms. However, the aforementioned changes in transport properties induced by post-annealing clearly suggest that the μ values in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms were limited by intragrain properties rather than by grain barriers. Finally, we discuss the role of solid-phase crystallization and H doping in the In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. The spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values greater than those of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms. In addition, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited increases in μ with negligible changes in N during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. These results suggest that solid-phase crystallization substantially reduced scattering by GBs and extended and point defects within grains. These ﬁndings are attributed to fewer lattice defects because of the use of solid-phase crystallization instead of low-temperature crystal growth by physical vapor deposition. This ﬁnding is supported by the structural properties explained in Section 2.1. By contrast, H doping increased N. As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6 (a), the overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,He ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors and by reduced carrier compensation through passivation of acceptors by hydrogen. Notably, the presence of hydrogen within the ﬁlms did not prevent activation of the Ce donors. However, further Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) resulted in saturation of N in conjunction with a decrease of μ. Conversely, W doping in In2O3:H apparently produced additional carrier scattering centers, as previously described. These results suggest that room may exist for further increasing N while maintaining a high μ by selecting appropriate metal dopants. 2.3. Optical Properties Figure 8 presents the optical constants for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, and (c) spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, as evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As observed in the extinction coefﬁcient (k) spectra, all of the ﬁlms were transparent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. In the longer-wavelength region (>1200 nm), k increased with increasing N because of free-carrier absorption. In addition, the refractive index (n) of the ﬁlms shifted toward lower values in the NIR region with increasing N, consistent with the Drude model. In the ultraviolet region, all of the ﬁlms exhibited strong absorption. Figure 9 shows the absorption coefﬁcients (α ¼ 4πk/λ) for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3: Me ﬁlms, and (c) spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms exhibited absorption onsets at 2.7–2.8 eV. The α values steeply increased to greater than 105 cm1 at photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV, and the absorption varied depending on the dopant species in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms. The absorption edges increased with increasing N (Figure 6(a)) in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms; this behavior is well explained by the Burstein–Moss shift. Next, we will consider the weaker absorption extending from the photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV to the onset energies of 2.7– 2.8 eV. In In2O3, a strong optical absorption at ca. 3.7 eV in the ultraviolet was assigned to a direct transition, whereas an onset of weaker optical absorption at ca. 2.6 eV was assigned to an indirect transition from the valence-band maximum (VBM) away from the Γ-point to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) at the Γ-point.[63] However, recent ﬁrst-principles calculations and photoemission spectroscopy have revealed that there is no nature of indirect transition.[64–66] Speciﬁcally, optical transitions at ca. 2.9 eV from the VBM to the CBM at the Γ-point are forbidden by the symmetry of the bixbyite crystal, whereas optical transitions at ca. 3.7 eV from the lower-lying valence-band states (0.8 eV below the VBM) to the CBM are parityallowed.[64] Figure 9(d) shows a plots of the α values of the ﬁlms as a function of the photon energy on a logarithmic scale. The spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm showed an α value much less than 103 cm1 at 3 eV and exhibited an absorption onset of 2.7– 2.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the α spectra of bulk In2O3 cystals,[63,67] suggesting high crystalline quality in the spc- status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

In addition, the onset energy reﬂects an indirect fundamental bandgap. The direct forbidden transitions weakly allowed away from the Γ-point may contribute to the absorption.[64–66] When compared with the spectra of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms, that of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited milder slopes; in addition, the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited a higher α value than the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm at 3 eV. Here, the slight shift of the α spectra along the horizontal axis is attributed to the difference in N values, as previously explained. The milder slope with higher α values reﬂects the existence of defect states in the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm. In addition, the structural disorder might weaken the selection rule of the direct forbidden transitions, giving rise to weak but non-negligible transitions. Furthermore, optical transitions that are forbidden by the selection rules could occur in the disordered structure of the a-In2O3:H ﬁlm, leading to α values much higher than those of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms. Notably, the spc-In2O3:W,H and poly-In2O3:W ﬁlms exhibited higher α values at 3 eV than other crystallized and polycrystalline ﬁlms, respectively, even though the W-doped ﬁlms exhibited crystallinity comparable to the other ﬁlms, as revealed by the SEM, XRD, and TEM analyses. The greater absorption in the W-doped ﬁlms may originate from W dstates.[68] 3. Conclusion Two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with mobilities substantially greater than that of ITO were recently reported. Poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibited mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures, and spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms fabricated at low temperatures exhibited mobilities greater 100 cm2 V1 s1. To determine the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and H codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms on glass substrates at 200 C and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms post-annealed at 250 C via RPD. The obtained [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values were [2.8 1019, 30], [1.5 1020, 90], [9.9 1019, 74], [1.4 1020, 85], and [1.8 1020, 94] for the poly-In2O3, In2O3:W (WO3: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively, whereas these values were [1.1 1020–1.5 1020, 140–160], [2.0 1020–2.4 1020, 82–84], [1.7 1020–2.1 1020, 140–160], [2.2 1020–2.4 1020, 130– 150], and [2.4 1020, 110–130] for the spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W, H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. The N values of the crystallized ﬁlms were 1 1020 cm3 higher than those of the corresponding ﬁlms, indicating that H doping produces 1 1020 cm3 free electrons. In addition, Ce and W doping increased the carrier density with increasing Me/In ratio in both spc-In2O3:Me,H and poly-In2O3:Me deposited at 200 C, suggesting that Ce and W function as electron donors and that the presence of H in the ﬁlms does not affect their carrier activation. Analysis of the N–μ and μ–temperature behaviors of the spc-In2O3:Me,H and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms strongly supported the hypothesis that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., Hi •, HO •, CeIn •) and that scattering induced by the ionized impurities and phonons dominated their μ values. Conversely, the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited a lower mobility of 80 cm2 V1 s1. The structural and electrical analyses and comparative studies between the spc-In2O3:W,H and polyIn2O3:W ﬁlms suggested the presence of point defects associated with W and H or OH species in the spc-In2O3:W, H ﬁlms. By contrast, poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce exhibited lower μ values than the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, respectively. Changes in the N and μ values after the post-annealing process indicated that the mobility of the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms was strongly limited by intragrain properties, i.e., scattering centers produced by stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects. Indeed, the SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the ﬁlms had small grains with abundant lattice defects, in sharp contrast to the case of crystallized ﬁlms with large grains with high crystallinity. Furthermore, the ﬁlms exhibited larger absorption tails at 3 eV compared with those of the crystallized ﬁlms. These results strongly suggest that the solid-phase crystallization process serves to substantially improve the intragrain properties. Furthermore, EBSD analysis revealed that the PH2O and the Me contents during deposition determined the density of the crystalline nuclei within the asdeposited amorphous ﬁlms and, thus, also determined the grain size of the crystallized ﬁlms. 4. Experimental Section Approximately 60-nm-thick and 220-nm-thick In2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrates and SiO2/Si substrates via RPD (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, URT-IP2).[69] We used ceramic tablets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) with different impurities: pure In2O3, In2O3 with a WO3 content of 1 wt.%, and In2O3 with CeO2 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.%. The deposition gases were Ar, O2, and H2O at a total pressure of 0.4 Pa. The flow ratio of O2 to Ar was fixed at 24%, whereas the PH2O was varied from 1 105 to 5 104 Pa before deposition monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (Inficon, Transpector XPR3). For the fabrication of the polyIn2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films, the films were deposited at 200 C. Here, we used the notation without H because the heated substrate and growth surface suppressed the incorporation of a large amount of hydrogen into the film, as described in Section 2.1. However, the a-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films were fabricated without intentional substrate heating. The maximum substrate temperatures were observed to be less than 60 C during deposition using thermolabels attached to the glass and SiO2/Si substrates. After deposition, some films were postannealed at 250 C under vacuum to obtain crystallized films. Most of the characterizations of the films were conducted using 220-nmthick films on glass. Hereafter, we describe the layer structure when the characterization was conducted using specimens other than 220-nm-thick films on glass. The hydrogen contents in the films were evaluated by HFS (CEA) and TDS (ESCO, EMD-1000S) using 220-nm-thick films on SiO2/Si substrates. The contents of metal impurities within the films were analyzed using ICP-MS (Agilent, 8900 ICP-QQQ). The surface morphology and crystallinity of the films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, S-4300) and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab), respectively. EBSD (JEOL, JSM-7001F) was used to evaluate the crystalline orientation of each grain at an electron acceleration voltage of 15keV. The ρ, N, and μ values of the films were determined from Hall measurements (Toyo, ResiTest8300) in van der Pauw configurations at roomtemperature. Thetemperaturedependenceoftheelectrical properties was also evaluated every 10 C from 40 to 250 C, with subsequent cooling from250 Ctoroomtemperature.Duringheating,thefilmscrystallized.The opticalconstantsofthefilmsweredeterminedbySE(J.A.Woolam,M-2000) using60-nm-thickfilmsonSiO2/Sisubstrates.Here,theopticalconstantsat each wavelength were mathematically derived by inverting the measured SE status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

High-mobility TCOs are needed to achieve high conductivity with improved visible and near-infrared transparency; however, the fabrication of TCO films on heat-sensitive layers or substrates is constrained by the trade-off between fabrication temperatures and TCO properties. Historically, Sn-doped indium oxide and amorphous In– Zn–O have been used as standard TCOs to achieve high mobility using low fabrication temperatures. However, two polycrystalline In2O3 films with significantly higher mobilities have recently been reported: i) polycrystalline (poly-) In2O3 films doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibit mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures and ii) solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) and In2O3:Ce,H films exhibit mobilities greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 when processed at low temperatures of 150–200 C. Here, poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films are fabricated. Comparative studies of these films reveal the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties. 1. Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms have been widely used as window electrodes in optoelectronic applications such as displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The continuous development of solar cells (e.g., thin-ﬁlm Si, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and Si-wafer-based heterojunction solar cells) has stimulated research on TCO ﬁlms (e.g., In2O3,[1–6] ZnO,[1,7–10] and SnO2 [11]). For example, high electron mobility is required for the TCO ﬁlms used in solar cells because a high-mobility results in a low sheet resistance at a low carrier density, providing high transparency with reduced free-carrier absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.[12–16] Low-temperature growth is also required because of the presence of temperature-sensitive layers in many solar cells (e.g., Si heterojunction,[17,18] Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2,[19,20] and perovskite[21,22] solar cells). Polycrystalline (poly-) Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)[23–25] and amorphous-In2O3-based TCOs (e.g., a-ITO[25,26] and a-In–Zn–O (a-IZO)[27,28]) have been broadly used to satisfy these requirements. Poly-ITO ﬁlms grown at temperatures below 200–300 C exhibit a high electron mobility (μ) of 40 cm2 V1 s1 with a low resistivity (ρ) of 1 104Ω cm,[29] whereas a-IZO ﬁlms deposited even at room temperature exhibit a high μ of 60 cm2 V1 s1 with a relatively low ρ of 3 104Ω cm.[30,31] Recently, two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with higher μ values have been reported. First, poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti,[1,32] Zr,[1,33,34] Mo,[1,35–39] or W[5,40]) impurities (In2O3:Me) instead of Sn exhibit μ values greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 at a carrier density (N) from 1 1020 to 3 1020 cm3. These ﬁlms are normally deposited onto heated substrates using various growth methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and ion plating with DC arc discharge, known as high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation or reactive plasma deposition (RPD)). Second, solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) ﬁlms exhibit μ values greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 with N values from 1 1020 to 2 1020 cm3 at low process temperatures from 150 to 200 C.[41] The ﬁlms are fabricated using a two-step growth process, speciﬁcally, the deposition of amorphous or amorphous-rich In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low temperatures via magnetron sputtering,[41] RPD,[42] or atomic layer deposition[43] and subsequently thermally annealed at a temperature greater than 150 C. During annealing, solid-phase crystallization occurs and high electron mobility is achieved. Similar properties have also been reported for CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 ﬁlms.[42] Notably, spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms on glass substrates fabricated at low process temperatures (200 C) exhibited higher μ values than Medoped epitaxial ﬁlms grown at high temperatures (600 C) on single-crystalline oxide substrates.[15,44,45] The mechanisms responsible for this high electron mobility have been investigated. Analysis of effective mass has been conducted as a function of N for various specimens, including Dr. T. Koida, Y. Ueno, Dr. H.

In In2O3:H ﬁlms, ab initio calculations revealed that interstitial H (Hi •) and substitutional H (HO •) function as singly charged donors, being energetically more favorable than an oxygen vacancy (VO ••).[55] Additionally, interstitial hydrogen atoms have been reported to passivate negatively charged acceptor-type cation vacancies.[56] Experimentally determined N and μ data have been evaluated on the basis of theoretical carrier scattering models and used to determine the doping mechanisms. The Hall mobility values agreed well with the calculated values dominated by singly charged impurities, which suggests that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, Hi •, HO •) rather than by doubly charged donors (e.g., VO ••) in In2O3:Me,[32,34,44] In2O3:H,[41] and In2O3:Ce,H.[42] However, the degenerately doped TCO ﬁlms exhibited higher electron mobility with constant N at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, indicating that the μ values measured at room temperature were limited not only by the ionized impurity scattering but also by phonon scattering.[34,41] Therefore, the good agreement of the values suggests imperfections of the modeled mobility. An extended model based on scatterings produced by phonon and ionized impurities has also been discussed.[49] Currently, the model cannot quantitatively explain the experimentally determined high μ values, especially at N values greater than 1 1019 cm3; however, a more in-depth understanding of acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering in these materials was achieved.[49,53,57] In this study, to clarify the commonalities and disparities between the two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with high μ, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms in the as-deposited state and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms and evaluated their structural, electrical, and optical properties. All of the ﬁlms were deposited using an RPD system, and the deposition conditions were ﬁxed as much as possible (except for variables such as the dopant species and concentrations, substrate temperatures, and H2O vapor pressures during growth) to minimize ﬂuctuations in ﬁlm properties as a consequence of changes in the experimental conditions. Comparative studies of these ﬁlms revealed the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resulting transport properties. Among the fabricated ﬁlms, the spc-In2O3:Ce,H exhibited the lowest ρ of 1.81 104 Ω cm with a μ of 154 cm2 V1 s1 and N of 2.24 1020 cm3. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Properties Table 1 summarizes the ratios of metal (W and Ce) to In determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the as-deposited In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms without substrate heating. In this analysis, the Cu and Mo impurity contents resulting from the RPD system were also measured to investigate their effect on the ﬁlms. The Cu, Mo, and Ce (W) concentrations in the In2O3:W,H (In2O3:Ce,H) ﬁlm were less than the lower detection limits (0.0036 at.% for Cu/In, 0.0024 at. % for Mo/In, 0.0016 at.% for Ce/In, and 0.0012 at.% for W/In) of the instrument. The W-to-In atomic ratio was 0.39 at.% in the In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, and the Ce-to-In ratios were 0.28, 0.96, and 1.3 at.% in the In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt. %) ﬁlms, respectively. Herein, we applied the same ratios in the post-annealed ﬁlms and the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C because tungsten oxides and cerium oxides did not effuse from the ﬁlms during annealing at 250 C, and the sticking coefﬁcients of W and Ce would not change signiﬁcantly at a substrate temperature of 200 C. Figure 1 plots the H contents in the ﬁlms as a function of the partial pressure of H2O (PH2O). The H contents systematically increased with increasing PH2O in the ﬁlms without substrate heating, whereas the values were below 0.5 at.% for the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The high PH2O of 2 104 to 3 104 Pa before the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me depositions originated from the degassing of H2O vapor from the areas around the heater in the RPD chamber.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis revealed that 10% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms deposited without substrate heating effused at temperatures as high as 250 C (not shown here), which is similar to the case of a-In2O3:H ﬁlms fabricated using magnetron sputtering.[47] Therefore, the H contents in the crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C did not substantially decrease compared with those in the as-deposited ﬁlms.[41,47] The same result was observed for the In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms; 9% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms effused at temperatures as high as 200 C, the growth temperature of the ﬁlms, indicating that most of the effusion originated from the bulk of the ﬁlms and not from adsorbates at the surface exposed to the atmosphere before the TDS characterization. Figure 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O. All of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited grain sizes of 50 nm. Conversely, all of the as-deposited In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms without substrate heating exhibited featureless structures with smooth surfaces because of the amorphous-phase formation (not shown here). After the post-annealing treatment at 250 C, the ﬁlms exhibited large grain structures. The grain size and shape were dependent on PH2O during deposition: the spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O exhibited only polygonal structures with larger grain sizes than the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, whereas the spcIn2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents deposited at low PH2O and all of the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O exhibited polygonal and ﬂower-like structures with substantially larger grains. Figure 3 presents the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the (a) glass substrate and poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and the as-deposited and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms deposited at PH2O of (b) 2 105 Pa and (c) 5 105 Pa. The XRD patterns do not show evidence of segregation of the tungsten oxides and cerium oxides in the In2O3:Me and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation of the <111> direction (Figure 3(a)). However, an increase in PH2O during deposition without substrate heating suppressed crystal growth. The as-deposited ﬁlms deposited at low PH2O (2 105 Pa) exhibited a very small 222 reﬂection with a broad peak originating from the amorphous structure (Figure 3(b)), whereas the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (5 105 Pa) exhibited amorphous structures without any diffraction peaks (Figure 3 (c)). After the post-annealing process, a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction was observed, especially for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)), indicating that small grains oriented in the <111> direction in the as-deposited ﬁlms acted as crystalline nuclei during the crystallization process. By contrast, a more randomly oriented structure was observed for the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high CeO2 contents (2 and 3 wt.%) deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)) and for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (Figure 3(c)). Figure 3 (d) plots d values of the 444 reﬂection (d444) for the ﬁlms shown in Figure 3(a)–(c). The d444 values of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms were larger than that of the In2O3 powders (d444 ¼ 0.1460 nm), indicating the formation of in-plane compressive strains in the ﬁlms. By contrast, those of the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H were nearly identical to that of the In2O3 powder, reﬂecting lessstrained ﬁlms. Furthermore, the crystallized ﬁlms exhibited smaller full-width at half-maximum values of the 222 reﬂection than the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C, indicating larger crystallite sizes and smaller strains in the ﬁlms. Notably, the large differences between the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms do not originate from the slight difference in fabrication temperatures (i.e., 200 C for the polycrystalline ﬁlms and 250 C for the solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms) but from the different ﬁlm-preparation methods.

Here, the image quality map shows the GB and strain contrast. As observed in Figure 4(b-1, c-1, d-1), most of the grains in the ﬁlm fabricated at low PH2O were oriented in the <111> direction normal to the surface with the <101> direction parallel to the surface. This result corresponds well to the θ–2θ pattern shown in Figure 3(b). In addition, a dark spot within each grain is observed in the image quality map (Figure 4(a-1)). The difference in contrast reﬂects the difference in crystalline quality, indicating that the dark spots correspond to the crystalline nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix, which were formed during deposition (Figure 3(b)). Hence, the map clearly suggests that the grain size (0.81 μm) of the post-annealed ﬁlm was determined by the density of the crystalline nuclei and that no new nuclei were formed during post-annealing. Conversely, the ﬁlm grown at high PH2O exhibited larger grain sizes Figure 2.

In contrast to Figure 4(a-1), Figure 4(a-2) shows no dark spots within the grains. In addition, the ﬁlm crystallized at higher temperatures than the ﬁlm grown at low PH2O, as will be explained in Section 2.2. Therefore, the formation of nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix would be well suppressed because of the high PH2O during deposition and crystalline nuclei would be formed during post-annealing. On the basis of these results, we discuss the crystal growth of these ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation in the <111> direction. Similar crystalline orientations have been observed in the XRD patterns of polyIn2O3 ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and without substrate heating at a very low PH2O of <5 106 Pa for ﬁlms prepared by magnetron sputtering.[41,45] Because the (111) surface energy is the lowest among the low-indexed surfaces in In2O3, including the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces,[58] the ﬁlms grown on glass would exhibit preferred orientation in the <111> direction. However, the introduction of larger amounts of Ce (CeO2: 2, 3 wt.%) and/ or H2O vapor prevented the preferred orientation (Figure 3(b) and (c)). According to crystal growth theory, a critical cluster size exists because of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the cluster to grow to become a nucleus. Therefore, the incorporation of Ce and H atoms or OH-related species at the growth front inﬂuences medium-range structures[59] in the amorphous ﬁlms with an increase in the barrier height, thereby leading to the formation of low-density nuclei with preferred orientation of the <111> direction and no nuclei within the amorphous matrix at low and high PH2O, respectively. Consequently, the post-annealed ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O exhibited a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction and random orientation, respectively. Here, in the latter ﬁlms, nucleation would be generated from nanoclusters with medium-range ordering and grow during post-annealing. The grain size of the ﬁlms deposited at high (low) PH2O was 5.5 μm (0.81 μm), which are far larger than that (0.44 μm) of the ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering.[47] This ﬁnding can be explained by the lower densities of crystalline nuclei in the Figure 3.

The electrical properties of the ﬁlms were measured during heating from 40 to 250 C and subsequent cooling from 250 C to room temperature under vacuum. During heating, solid-phase crystallization occurred. In Figure 5(a), the as-deposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at high PH2O exhibited a constant N at temperatures below 180 C, indicating that the ﬁlm was a degenerately doped semiconductor. However, a large decrease in N combined with an increase in μ was clearly observed at 180–200 C. Previous XRD and SEM analyses for aIn2O3:H ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering revealed that crystallization proceeded at the temperatures at which the N and μ values varied.[47] Therefore, the change observed in Figure 5(a) originated from the increase in the volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the ﬁlm. Upon full crystallization, the ﬁlm exhibited a constant N at temperatures over the entire range and Figure 4.

In the asdeposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low PH2O, the change in N occurred at lower temperatures (130–150 C), which can be explained by the presence of abundant crystalline nuclei within the as-deposited ﬁlm described in Section 2.1, thereby leading to full crystallization at lower temperatures. This ﬁnding is also true for the a-In2O3:W,H and a-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with a small amount of Ce (Figure 5(b) and (c)). However, the temperature increased with increasing Ce content (Figure 5(c)–(e)): i.e., 160– 180 C (200–220 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, 180– 200 C (190–210 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 2 wt.%) ﬁlms, and 180–200 C (210–230 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low (high) PH2O. The Ce doping increased the crystallization temperature. As shown in Figure 5, all of the as-deposited ﬁlms exhibited higher N values when deposited at high PH2O. In general, the N of a-In2O3-based TCOs, including a-IZO, a-ITO, and a-In2O3:H, can be controlled by the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm.[59,61] Herein, only PH2O was varied; the O2 and Ar ﬂow rates were constant. Therefore, the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm increased with increasing PH2O because of the presence of H radicals and ions produced in the plasma during deposition. Here, we assume that the N values in the a-In2O3:H and a-In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms were basically determined by the oxygen stoichiometry Figure 5.

Figure 6(a) summarizes the ρ, N, and μ values as a function on the Me/In ratio for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solidphase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The dotted line in the middle panel of Figure 6(a) shows the expected N for which all the carriers are generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, WIn •••Oi00). As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), N of the amorphous ﬁlms did not increase with increasing Me/In ratio and instead decreased with increasing Ce/In ratio. The results clearly demonstrate that Me did not act as an electron donor in the amorphous phase and that Ce doping reduced the oxygen deﬁciency within the a-In2O3 matrix, likely because of the higher bond strength of Ce–O than In–O. Moreover, the μ values decreased with increasing Ce content, indicating that Ce atoms act as scattering centers for free electrons in the amorphous structure. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon crystallization of the In2O3:H layer, N decreased with a large increase in μ. In addition, the slope of mobility as a function of temperature increased after crystallization. These results suggest a change in the carrier generation and scattering mechanisms. In previous works, we proposed that structural rearrangements during crystallization eliminate oxygen-vacancy-type defects with a large scattering cross section and produce Hi • and/or HO •, which act as singly charged donors.[41,47] In In2O3:W,H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, decreases of N were observed at the crystallization temperatures. However, the magnitude of the decreases of N decreased with increasing Me contents. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), the N values of the crystallized In2O3:H ﬁlms were 1 1020–1.5 1020 cm3 because of the Hi • and/or HO • donors. As the Me content was increased to 0.39 at.%, the N values increased with a similar slope of the dotted line. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a gradual increase of the N values. These results demonstrate that W and Ce were activated as donors by the crystallization process even in the presence of hydrogen. By contrast, the N of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm deposited at 200 C was 3 1019 cm3. The free carriers are assumed to be generated from intrinsic defects, mainly from oxygen-vacancytype defects, as revealed in previous works.[34,44] When the ﬁlms were doped with low Me contents, the N values increased in Figure 6.

A further increase in the Ce/In ratio increased the N values although the values were below the dotted line. These results indicate that Wand Ce work as electron donors. The overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors. Notably, the H contents determined by TDS and hydrogen forward-scattering spectrometry (HFS) reveal that large amounts of hydrogen are present that do not contribute to the carrier generation. The hydrogen passivates acceptors[56] to reduce the carrier compensation because the In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited signiﬁcantly high μ, as described below. We here focus on the μ values of the ﬁlms. Figure 6(b) summarizes the relationship between N and μ measured at room temperature for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. At a glance, the μ values varied depending on the ﬁlm structure and fabrication processes: the a-In2O3:H and In2O3: Me,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 40–60 cm2 V1 s1, the polyIn2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 30–90 cm2 V1 s1 that strongly depended on Me, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce, H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 110–160 cm2 V1 s1, and the spcIn2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 80 cm2 V1 s1. In general, the mobility of polycrystalline TCO ﬁlms is dominated by scattering produced by GBs, stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including ionized and neutral impurities, and phonons.[51,52] To distinguish between the contributions of the various scattering sources, a comparison of the Hall and optical mobilities and measurements of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect are useful. The ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility reﬂects the effect of GB scattering: a ratio of 1 implies that GB scattering plays a negligible effect in the ﬁlms, whereas a ratio less than 1 implies that GB scattering inﬂuences the μ values, as explained in Section 1. When transport across GBs occurs mainly through thermionic emission instead of tunneling, the effect of GB scattering on the μ values increases with decreasing temperature.[51–53] This trend is also true for scattering induced by charged extended defects.[52] By contrast, scattering induced by ionized and neutral impurities is independent of temperature in a degenerately doped semiconductor, whereas phonon scattering becomes large with increasing temperature. From a previous analysis of spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms that exhibit transport properties similar to those shown in Figure 6, the Hall mobilities were equal to the optical mobilities,[47] suggesting that GB scattering plays a negligible effect and that intragrain properties limit the Hall mobilities in the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms. Figure 7 shows a plot of the data in Figure 5 for the spc-In2O3: H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms during the cooling process from 250 C to room temperature; the mobilities are plotted versus the corresponding carrier densities with temperature acting as parameter. The spc-In2O3:H and spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited i) a slight decrease in N with an increase in μ from 250 to 230 C and ii) a large increase in μ with a negligible change in N from 230 C to room temperature. The former result is explained by the desorption of H from the ﬁlms during heating under vacuum, whereas the latter result clearly suggests that phonon scattering dominates the ﬁlms’ μ values. The spcIn2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O and the spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O exhibited high μ values of 160 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature. The high μ values with N values of 1 1020–2 1020 cm3 cannot be quantitatively explained by the current models,[49] as described in Section 1. However, the μ values strongly suggest that scattering produced by neutral and doubly charged ionized impurities is negligible and that their mobilities are limited by singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •) and by phonon scattering.[49] Indeed, the dominant valence states of Ce have been reported to be 3þ and 4þ in In2O3:Ce,H and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms.[6] Conversely, the μ values for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O increased slowly with decreasing temperature and the ﬁlm exhibited lower μ values at room temperature than the ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O. Plausibly, charged extended and point defects within grains are present in the ﬁlm because of low H contents and/or H effusion from the ﬁlm during post-annealing. Indeed, decreases in both the Hall and the optical mobility were observed in spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms when the ﬁlms were postannealed at higher temperatures (400 C).[47] By contrast, the μ values of the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents increased and N decreased during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a large decrease of μ and a slight increase of N (Figure 6 and 7). These results imply that extensive Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) produced carrier scattering centers in addition to the singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •), leading to compensation of the free carriers, likely via the formation of defect complexes such as 2 CeIn •Oi00 in the ﬁlms. By contrast, spc-In2O3:W,H Figure 7. Variation of the carrier density (N) and mobility (μ) of spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films during cooling from 250 C to room temperature.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License exhibited much lower μ values at 250 C and room temperature, indicating that W doping produces other scattering centers. Because no large difference in the structure was detected between the spc-In2O3:W,H and spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms by XRD, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not shown here) analyses, the point defects within the grains that cannot be assessed by these characterization tools may be responsible for the low mobility. In addition, post-annealing of the poly-In2O3:W ﬁlm at 300 C increased the μ values to 110 cm2 V1 s1, much higher than the μ values of the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms, as will be shown later. The same post-annealing process was performed for the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms; however, the μ values of the ﬁlms did not increase (not shown here). Therefore, point defects associated with W and H or OH species may be responsible for the other scattering centers produced in the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms. With respect to the carrier scattering in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms, Figure 6(a) and (b) shows that the μ values of the polyIn2O3:Ce ﬁlms were much smaller than those of the corresponding spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms. To investigate the dominant scattering centers in the polycrystalline ﬁlms, we postannealed the ﬁlms at 300 C. The [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values varied from [1.7 1020, 82] to [1.7 1020, 110], from [1.1 1020, 70] to [1.1 1020, 96], from [1.5 1020, 81] to [1.5 1020, 100], and from [1.9 1020, 88] to [2.0 1020, 110] after the post-annealing process for the poly-In2O3:W, poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), poly-In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 2 wt.%), and poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. In all of the ﬁlms, μ values increased with a negligible change in N. The mobility improvement was not accompanied by a change of the structural properties, as revealed by XRD (not shown). Thus, no recrystallization occurred during the post-annealing process. However, the point and extended defect densities were plausibly reduced by the process. That is, the as-deposited poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms contained a large amount of point and extended defects because of the low-temperature deposition and their mobilities were limited largely by intragrain properties. Notably, a linear increase of μ values with increasing N in Figure 6(b) for the asdeposited poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms seems like a suggestion at a glance that the GB scattering strongly inﬂuences the μ values if we assume similar grain sizes and trap densities at GBs in the polycrystalline ﬁlms. However, the aforementioned changes in transport properties induced by post-annealing clearly suggest that the μ values in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms were limited by intragrain properties rather than by grain barriers. Finally, we discuss the role of solid-phase crystallization and H doping in the In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. The spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values greater than those of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms. In addition, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited increases in μ with negligible changes in N during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. These results suggest that solid-phase crystallization substantially reduced scattering by GBs and extended and point defects within grains. These ﬁndings are attributed to fewer lattice defects because of the use of solid-phase crystallization instead of low-temperature crystal growth by physical vapor deposition. This ﬁnding is supported by the structural properties explained in Section 2.1. By contrast, H doping increased N. As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6 (a), the overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,He ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors and by reduced carrier compensation through passivation of acceptors by hydrogen. Notably, the presence of hydrogen within the ﬁlms did not prevent activation of the Ce donors. However, further Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) resulted in saturation of N in conjunction with a decrease of μ. Conversely, W doping in In2O3:H apparently produced additional carrier scattering centers, as previously described. These results suggest that room may exist for further increasing N while maintaining a high μ by selecting appropriate metal dopants. 2.3. Optical Properties Figure 8 presents the optical constants for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, and (c) spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, as evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As observed in the extinction coefﬁcient (k) spectra, all of the ﬁlms were transparent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. In the longer-wavelength region (>1200 nm), k increased with increasing N because of free-carrier absorption. In addition, the refractive index (n) of the ﬁlms shifted toward lower values in the NIR region with increasing N, consistent with the Drude model. In the ultraviolet region, all of the ﬁlms exhibited strong absorption. Figure 9 shows the absorption coefﬁcients (α ¼ 4πk/λ) for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3: Me ﬁlms, and (c) spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms exhibited absorption onsets at 2.7–2.8 eV. The α values steeply increased to greater than 105 cm1 at photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV, and the absorption varied depending on the dopant species in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms. The absorption edges increased with increasing N (Figure 6(a)) in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms; this behavior is well explained by the Burstein–Moss shift. Next, we will consider the weaker absorption extending from the photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV to the onset energies of 2.7– 2.8 eV. In In2O3, a strong optical absorption at ca. 3.7 eV in the ultraviolet was assigned to a direct transition, whereas an onset of weaker optical absorption at ca. 2.6 eV was assigned to an indirect transition from the valence-band maximum (VBM) away from the Γ-point to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) at the Γ-point.[63] However, recent ﬁrst-principles calculations and photoemission spectroscopy have revealed that there is no nature of indirect transition.[64–66] Speciﬁcally, optical transitions at ca. 2.9 eV from the VBM to the CBM at the Γ-point are forbidden by the symmetry of the bixbyite crystal, whereas optical transitions at ca. 3.7 eV from the lower-lying valence-band states (0.8 eV below the VBM) to the CBM are parityallowed.[64] Figure 9(d) shows a plots of the α values of the ﬁlms as a function of the photon energy on a logarithmic scale. The spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm showed an α value much less than 103 cm1 at 3 eV and exhibited an absorption onset of 2.7– 2.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the α spectra of bulk In2O3 cystals,[63,67] suggesting high crystalline quality in the spc- status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

In addition, the onset energy reﬂects an indirect fundamental bandgap. The direct forbidden transitions weakly allowed away from the Γ-point may contribute to the absorption.[64–66] When compared with the spectra of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms, that of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited milder slopes; in addition, the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited a higher α value than the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm at 3 eV. Here, the slight shift of the α spectra along the horizontal axis is attributed to the difference in N values, as previously explained. The milder slope with higher α values reﬂects the existence of defect states in the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm. In addition, the structural disorder might weaken the selection rule of the direct forbidden transitions, giving rise to weak but non-negligible transitions. Furthermore, optical transitions that are forbidden by the selection rules could occur in the disordered structure of the a-In2O3:H ﬁlm, leading to α values much higher than those of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms. Notably, the spc-In2O3:W,H and poly-In2O3:W ﬁlms exhibited higher α values at 3 eV than other crystallized and polycrystalline ﬁlms, respectively, even though the W-doped ﬁlms exhibited crystallinity comparable to the other ﬁlms, as revealed by the SEM, XRD, and TEM analyses. The greater absorption in the W-doped ﬁlms may originate from W dstates.[68] 3. Conclusion Two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with mobilities substantially greater than that of ITO were recently reported. Poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibited mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures, and spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms fabricated at low temperatures exhibited mobilities greater 100 cm2 V1 s1. To determine the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and H codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms on glass substrates at 200 C and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms post-annealed at 250 C via RPD. The obtained [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values were [2.8 1019, 30], [1.5 1020, 90], [9.9 1019, 74], [1.4 1020, 85], and [1.8 1020, 94] for the poly-In2O3, In2O3:W (WO3: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively, whereas these values were [1.1 1020–1.5 1020, 140–160], [2.0 1020–2.4 1020, 82–84], [1.7 1020–2.1 1020, 140–160], [2.2 1020–2.4 1020, 130– 150], and [2.4 1020, 110–130] for the spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W, H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. The N values of the crystallized ﬁlms were 1 1020 cm3 higher than those of the corresponding ﬁlms, indicating that H doping produces 1 1020 cm3 free electrons. In addition, Ce and W doping increased the carrier density with increasing Me/In ratio in both spc-In2O3:Me,H and poly-In2O3:Me deposited at 200 C, suggesting that Ce and W function as electron donors and that the presence of H in the ﬁlms does not affect their carrier activation. Analysis of the N–μ and μ–temperature behaviors of the spc-In2O3:Me,H and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms strongly supported the hypothesis that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., Hi •, HO •, CeIn •) and that scattering induced by the ionized impurities and phonons dominated their μ values. Conversely, the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited a lower mobility of 80 cm2 V1 s1. The structural and electrical analyses and comparative studies between the spc-In2O3:W,H and polyIn2O3:W ﬁlms suggested the presence of point defects associated with W and H or OH species in the spc-In2O3:W, H ﬁlms. By contrast, poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce exhibited lower μ values than the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, respectively. Changes in the N and μ values after the post-annealing process indicated that the mobility of the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms was strongly limited by intragrain properties, i.e., scattering centers produced by stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects. Indeed, the SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the ﬁlms had small grains with abundant lattice defects, in sharp contrast to the case of crystallized ﬁlms with large grains with high crystallinity. Furthermore, the ﬁlms exhibited larger absorption tails at 3 eV compared with those of the crystallized ﬁlms. These results strongly suggest that the solid-phase crystallization process serves to substantially improve the intragrain properties. Furthermore, EBSD analysis revealed that the PH2O and the Me contents during deposition determined the density of the crystalline nuclei within the asdeposited amorphous ﬁlms and, thus, also determined the grain size of the crystallized ﬁlms. 4. Experimental Section Approximately 60-nm-thick and 220-nm-thick In2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrates and SiO2/Si substrates via RPD (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, URT-IP2).[69] We used ceramic tablets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) with different impurities: pure In2O3, In2O3 with a WO3 content of 1 wt.%, and In2O3 with CeO2 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.%. The deposition gases were Ar, O2, and H2O at a total pressure of 0.4 Pa. The flow ratio of O2 to Ar was fixed at 24%, whereas the PH2O was varied from 1 105 to 5 104 Pa before deposition monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (Inficon, Transpector XPR3). For the fabrication of the polyIn2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films, the films were deposited at 200 C. Here, we used the notation without H because the heated substrate and growth surface suppressed the incorporation of a large amount of hydrogen into the film, as described in Section 2.1. However, the a-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films were fabricated without intentional substrate heating. The maximum substrate temperatures were observed to be less than 60 C during deposition using thermolabels attached to the glass and SiO2/Si substrates. After deposition, some films were postannealed at 250 C under vacuum to obtain crystallized films. Most of the characterizations of the films were conducted using 220-nmthick films on glass. Hereafter, we describe the layer structure when the characterization was conducted using specimens other than 220-nm-thick films on glass. The hydrogen contents in the films were evaluated by HFS (CEA) and TDS (ESCO, EMD-1000S) using 220-nm-thick films on SiO2/Si substrates. The contents of metal impurities within the films were analyzed using ICP-MS (Agilent, 8900 ICP-QQQ). The surface morphology and crystallinity of the films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, S-4300) and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab), respectively. EBSD (JEOL, JSM-7001F) was used to evaluate the crystalline orientation of each grain at an electron acceleration voltage of 15keV. The ρ, N, and μ values of the films were determined from Hall measurements (Toyo, ResiTest8300) in van der Pauw configurations at roomtemperature. Thetemperaturedependenceoftheelectrical properties was also evaluated every 10 C from 40 to 250 C, with subsequent cooling from250 Ctoroomtemperature.Duringheating,thefilmscrystallized.The opticalconstantsofthefilmsweredeterminedbySE(J.A.Woolam,M-2000) using60-nm-thickfilmsonSiO2/Sisubstrates.Here,theopticalconstantsat each wavelength were mathematically derived by inverting the measured SE status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

High-mobility TCOs are needed to achieve high conductivity with improved visible and near-infrared transparency; however, the fabrication of TCO films on heat-sensitive layers or substrates is constrained by the trade-off between fabrication temperatures and TCO properties. Historically, Sn-doped indium oxide and amorphous In– Zn–O have been used as standard TCOs to achieve high mobility using low fabrication temperatures. However, two polycrystalline In2O3 films with significantly higher mobilities have recently been reported: i) polycrystalline (poly-) In2O3 films doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibit mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures and ii) solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) and In2O3:Ce,H films exhibit mobilities greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 when processed at low temperatures of 150–200 C. Here, poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films are fabricated. Comparative studies of these films reveal the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties. 1. Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms have been widely used as window electrodes in optoelectronic applications such as displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The continuous development of solar cells (e.g., thin-ﬁlm Si, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and Si-wafer-based heterojunction solar cells) has stimulated research on TCO ﬁlms (e.g., In2O3,[1–6] ZnO,[1,7–10] and SnO2 [11]). For example, high electron mobility is required for the TCO ﬁlms used in solar cells because a high-mobility results in a low sheet resistance at a low carrier density, providing high transparency with reduced free-carrier absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.[12–16] Low-temperature growth is also required because of the presence of temperature-sensitive layers in many solar cells (e.g., Si heterojunction,[17,18] Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2,[19,20] and perovskite[21,22] solar cells). Polycrystalline (poly-) Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)[23–25] and amorphous-In2O3-based TCOs (e.g., a-ITO[25,26] and a-In–Zn–O (a-IZO)[27,28]) have been broadly used to satisfy these requirements. Poly-ITO ﬁlms grown at temperatures below 200–300 C exhibit a high electron mobility (μ) of 40 cm2 V1 s1 with a low resistivity (ρ) of 1 104Ω cm,[29] whereas a-IZO ﬁlms deposited even at room temperature exhibit a high μ of 60 cm2 V1 s1 with a relatively low ρ of 3 104Ω cm.[30,31] Recently, two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with higher μ values have been reported. First, poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti,[1,32] Zr,[1,33,34] Mo,[1,35–39] or W[5,40]) impurities (In2O3:Me) instead of Sn exhibit μ values greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 at a carrier density (N) from 1 1020 to 3 1020 cm3. These ﬁlms are normally deposited onto heated substrates using various growth methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and ion plating with DC arc discharge, known as high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation or reactive plasma deposition (RPD)). Second, solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) ﬁlms exhibit μ values greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 with N values from 1 1020 to 2 1020 cm3 at low process temperatures from 150 to 200 C.[41] The ﬁlms are fabricated using a two-step growth process, speciﬁcally, the deposition of amorphous or amorphous-rich In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low temperatures via magnetron sputtering,[41] RPD,[42] or atomic layer deposition[43] and subsequently thermally annealed at a temperature greater than 150 C. During annealing, solid-phase crystallization occurs and high electron mobility is achieved. Similar properties have also been reported for CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 ﬁlms.[42] Notably, spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms on glass substrates fabricated at low process temperatures (200 C) exhibited higher μ values than Medoped epitaxial ﬁlms grown at high temperatures (600 C) on single-crystalline oxide substrates.[15,44,45] The mechanisms responsible for this high electron mobility have been investigated. Analysis of effective mass has been conducted as a function of N for various specimens, including Dr. T. Koida, Y. Ueno, Dr. H.

KGaA, Weinheim 1700506 (1 of 14) polycrystalline and epitaxial ﬁlms and bulk single crystals, to determine the curvature of the energy band as a function of the Fermi energy.[38,40,46–50] High-μ TCO ﬁlms exhibited an electron effective mass similar to those of conventional poly-ITO and aIn2O3-based TCO ﬁlms, indicating that high μ is achieved through a larger relaxation time rather than a smaller effective mass.[47,49] In polycrystalline ﬁlms, the overall relaxation time is determined by scattering induced by grain boundaries (GBs), stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including neutral and ionized impurities, and phonons.[51,52] The effect of GB scattering can be evaluated from the ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility: Hall mobilities are affected by GB scattering when electrons transport across GBs, whereas optical mobilities are not affected by GBs because free electrons exist inside grains and because the amplitude of oscillation of an electron under the inﬂuence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the grain sizes in typical TCO ﬁlms.[13] In the spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms, the effect of GBs was found to be minor because these ﬁlms’ optical mobilities were comparable to their Hall mobilities.[47] Furthermore, the effects of dopant species (Me and H) on the grain-barrier height and resulting transport properties in polycrystalline ﬁlms have also been discussed.[53] With respect to intragrain properties, suppressed scattering from oxygen interstitials[36,39,40] originating from the formation of the singly charged donor (e.g., MoIn •••Oi00, WIn •••Oi00) and suppressed scattering from defects related to oxygen deﬁciencies[34,42,44,54] originating from the introduction of metals with higher bond strength with O than In and Sn in the In2O3 host material have been discussed. In In2O3:H ﬁlms, ab initio calculations revealed that interstitial H (Hi •) and substitutional H (HO •) function as singly charged donors, being energetically more favorable than an oxygen vacancy (VO ••).[55] Additionally, interstitial hydrogen atoms have been reported to passivate negatively charged acceptor-type cation vacancies.[56] Experimentally determined N and μ data have been evaluated on the basis of theoretical carrier scattering models and used to determine the doping mechanisms. The Hall mobility values agreed well with the calculated values dominated by singly charged impurities, which suggests that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, Hi •, HO •) rather than by doubly charged donors (e.g., VO ••) in In2O3:Me,[32,34,44] In2O3:H,[41] and In2O3:Ce,H.[42] However, the degenerately doped TCO ﬁlms exhibited higher electron mobility with constant N at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, indicating that the μ values measured at room temperature were limited not only by the ionized impurity scattering but also by phonon scattering.[34,41] Therefore, the good agreement of the values suggests imperfections of the modeled mobility. An extended model based on scatterings produced by phonon and ionized impurities has also been discussed.[49] Currently, the model cannot quantitatively explain the experimentally determined high μ values, especially at N values greater than 1 1019 cm3; however, a more in-depth understanding of acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering in these materials was achieved.[49,53,57] In this study, to clarify the commonalities and disparities between the two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with high μ, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms in the as-deposited state and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms and evaluated their structural, electrical, and optical properties. All of the ﬁlms were deposited using an RPD system, and the deposition conditions were ﬁxed as much as possible (except for variables such as the dopant species and concentrations, substrate temperatures, and H2O vapor pressures during growth) to minimize ﬂuctuations in ﬁlm properties as a consequence of changes in the experimental conditions. Comparative studies of these ﬁlms revealed the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resulting transport properties. Among the fabricated ﬁlms, the spc-In2O3:Ce,H exhibited the lowest ρ of 1.81 104 Ω cm with a μ of 154 cm2 V1 s1 and N of 2.24 1020 cm3. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Properties Table 1 summarizes the ratios of metal (W and Ce) to In determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the as-deposited In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms without substrate heating. In this analysis, the Cu and Mo impurity contents resulting from the RPD system were also measured to investigate their effect on the ﬁlms. The Cu, Mo, and Ce (W) concentrations in the In2O3:W,H (In2O3:Ce,H) ﬁlm were less than the lower detection limits (0.0036 at.% for Cu/In, 0.0024 at. % for Mo/In, 0.0016 at.% for Ce/In, and 0.0012 at.% for W/In) of the instrument. The W-to-In atomic ratio was 0.39 at.% in the In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, and the Ce-to-In ratios were 0.28, 0.96, and 1.3 at.% in the In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt. %) ﬁlms, respectively. Herein, we applied the same ratios in the post-annealed ﬁlms and the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C because tungsten oxides and cerium oxides did not effuse from the ﬁlms during annealing at 250 C, and the sticking coefﬁcients of W and Ce would not change signiﬁcantly at a substrate temperature of 200 C. Figure 1 plots the H contents in the ﬁlms as a function of the partial pressure of H2O (PH2O). The H contents systematically increased with increasing PH2O in the ﬁlms without substrate heating, whereas the values were below 0.5 at.% for the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The high PH2O of 2 104 to 3 104 Pa before the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me depositions originated from the degassing of H2O vapor from the areas around the heater in the RPD chamber. The large difference in H contents between Table 1.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis revealed that 10% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms deposited without substrate heating effused at temperatures as high as 250 C (not shown here), which is similar to the case of a-In2O3:H ﬁlms fabricated using magnetron sputtering.[47] Therefore, the H contents in the crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C did not substantially decrease compared with those in the as-deposited ﬁlms.[41,47] The same result was observed for the In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms; 9% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms effused at temperatures as high as 200 C, the growth temperature of the ﬁlms, indicating that most of the effusion originated from the bulk of the ﬁlms and not from adsorbates at the surface exposed to the atmosphere before the TDS characterization. Figure 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O. All of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited grain sizes of 50 nm. Conversely, all of the as-deposited In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms without substrate heating exhibited featureless structures with smooth surfaces because of the amorphous-phase formation (not shown here). After the post-annealing treatment at 250 C, the ﬁlms exhibited large grain structures. The grain size and shape were dependent on PH2O during deposition: the spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O exhibited only polygonal structures with larger grain sizes than the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, whereas the spcIn2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents deposited at low PH2O and all of the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O exhibited polygonal and ﬂower-like structures with substantially larger grains. Figure 3 presents the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the (a) glass substrate and poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and the as-deposited and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms deposited at PH2O of (b) 2 105 Pa and (c) 5 105 Pa. The XRD patterns do not show evidence of segregation of the tungsten oxides and cerium oxides in the In2O3:Me and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation of the <111> direction (Figure 3(a)). However, an increase in PH2O during deposition without substrate heating suppressed crystal growth. The as-deposited ﬁlms deposited at low PH2O (2 105 Pa) exhibited a very small 222 reﬂection with a broad peak originating from the amorphous structure (Figure 3(b)), whereas the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (5 105 Pa) exhibited amorphous structures without any diffraction peaks (Figure 3 (c)). After the post-annealing process, a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction was observed, especially for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)), indicating that small grains oriented in the <111> direction in the as-deposited ﬁlms acted as crystalline nuclei during the crystallization process. By contrast, a more randomly oriented structure was observed for the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high CeO2 contents (2 and 3 wt.%) deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)) and for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (Figure 3(c)). Figure 3 (d) plots d values of the 444 reﬂection (d444) for the ﬁlms shown in Figure 3(a)–(c). The d444 values of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms were larger than that of the In2O3 powders (d444 ¼ 0.1460 nm), indicating the formation of in-plane compressive strains in the ﬁlms. By contrast, those of the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H were nearly identical to that of the In2O3 powder, reﬂecting lessstrained ﬁlms. Furthermore, the crystallized ﬁlms exhibited smaller full-width at half-maximum values of the 222 reﬂection than the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C, indicating larger crystallite sizes and smaller strains in the ﬁlms. Notably, the large differences between the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms do not originate from the slight difference in fabrication temperatures (i.e., 200 C for the polycrystalline ﬁlms and 250 C for the solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms) but from the different ﬁlm-preparation methods.

Here, the image quality map shows the GB and strain contrast. As observed in Figure 4(b-1, c-1, d-1), most of the grains in the ﬁlm fabricated at low PH2O were oriented in the <111> direction normal to the surface with the <101> direction parallel to the surface. This result corresponds well to the θ–2θ pattern shown in Figure 3(b). In addition, a dark spot within each grain is observed in the image quality map (Figure 4(a-1)). The difference in contrast reﬂects the difference in crystalline quality, indicating that the dark spots correspond to the crystalline nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix, which were formed during deposition (Figure 3(b)). Hence, the map clearly suggests that the grain size (0.81 μm) of the post-annealed ﬁlm was determined by the density of the crystalline nuclei and that no new nuclei were formed during post-annealing. Conversely, the ﬁlm grown at high PH2O exhibited larger grain sizes Figure 2.

In contrast to Figure 4(a-1), Figure 4(a-2) shows no dark spots within the grains. In addition, the ﬁlm crystallized at higher temperatures than the ﬁlm grown at low PH2O, as will be explained in Section 2.2. Therefore, the formation of nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix would be well suppressed because of the high PH2O during deposition and crystalline nuclei would be formed during post-annealing. On the basis of these results, we discuss the crystal growth of these ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation in the <111> direction. Similar crystalline orientations have been observed in the XRD patterns of polyIn2O3 ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and without substrate heating at a very low PH2O of <5 106 Pa for ﬁlms prepared by magnetron sputtering.[41,45] Because the (111) surface energy is the lowest among the low-indexed surfaces in In2O3, including the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces,[58] the ﬁlms grown on glass would exhibit preferred orientation in the <111> direction. However, the introduction of larger amounts of Ce (CeO2: 2, 3 wt.%) and/ or H2O vapor prevented the preferred orientation (Figure 3(b) and (c)). According to crystal growth theory, a critical cluster size exists because of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the cluster to grow to become a nucleus. Therefore, the incorporation of Ce and H atoms or OH-related species at the growth front inﬂuences medium-range structures[59] in the amorphous ﬁlms with an increase in the barrier height, thereby leading to the formation of low-density nuclei with preferred orientation of the <111> direction and no nuclei within the amorphous matrix at low and high PH2O, respectively. Consequently, the post-annealed ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O exhibited a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction and random orientation, respectively. Here, in the latter ﬁlms, nucleation would be generated from nanoclusters with medium-range ordering and grow during post-annealing. The grain size of the ﬁlms deposited at high (low) PH2O was 5.5 μm (0.81 μm), which are far larger than that (0.44 μm) of the ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering.[47] This ﬁnding can be explained by the lower densities of crystalline nuclei in the Figure 3.

The electrical properties of the ﬁlms were measured during heating from 40 to 250 C and subsequent cooling from 250 C to room temperature under vacuum. During heating, solid-phase crystallization occurred. In Figure 5(a), the as-deposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at high PH2O exhibited a constant N at temperatures below 180 C, indicating that the ﬁlm was a degenerately doped semiconductor. However, a large decrease in N combined with an increase in μ was clearly observed at 180–200 C. Previous XRD and SEM analyses for aIn2O3:H ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering revealed that crystallization proceeded at the temperatures at which the N and μ values varied.[47] Therefore, the change observed in Figure 5(a) originated from the increase in the volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the ﬁlm. Upon full crystallization, the ﬁlm exhibited a constant N at temperatures over the entire range and Figure 4.

In the asdeposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low PH2O, the change in N occurred at lower temperatures (130–150 C), which can be explained by the presence of abundant crystalline nuclei within the as-deposited ﬁlm described in Section 2.1, thereby leading to full crystallization at lower temperatures. This ﬁnding is also true for the a-In2O3:W,H and a-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with a small amount of Ce (Figure 5(b) and (c)). However, the temperature increased with increasing Ce content (Figure 5(c)–(e)): i.e., 160– 180 C (200–220 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, 180– 200 C (190–210 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 2 wt.%) ﬁlms, and 180–200 C (210–230 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low (high) PH2O. The Ce doping increased the crystallization temperature. As shown in Figure 5, all of the as-deposited ﬁlms exhibited higher N values when deposited at high PH2O. In general, the N of a-In2O3-based TCOs, including a-IZO, a-ITO, and a-In2O3:H, can be controlled by the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm.[59,61] Herein, only PH2O was varied; the O2 and Ar ﬂow rates were constant. Therefore, the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm increased with increasing PH2O because of the presence of H radicals and ions produced in the plasma during deposition. Here, we assume that the N values in the a-In2O3:H and a-In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms were basically determined by the oxygen stoichiometry Figure 5.

Figure 6(a) summarizes the ρ, N, and μ values as a function on the Me/In ratio for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solidphase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The dotted line in the middle panel of Figure 6(a) shows the expected N for which all the carriers are generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, WIn •••Oi00). As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), N of the amorphous ﬁlms did not increase with increasing Me/In ratio and instead decreased with increasing Ce/In ratio. The results clearly demonstrate that Me did not act as an electron donor in the amorphous phase and that Ce doping reduced the oxygen deﬁciency within the a-In2O3 matrix, likely because of the higher bond strength of Ce–O than In–O. Moreover, the μ values decreased with increasing Ce content, indicating that Ce atoms act as scattering centers for free electrons in the amorphous structure. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon crystallization of the In2O3:H layer, N decreased with a large increase in μ. In addition, the slope of mobility as a function of temperature increased after crystallization. These results suggest a change in the carrier generation and scattering mechanisms. In previous works, we proposed that structural rearrangements during crystallization eliminate oxygen-vacancy-type defects with a large scattering cross section and produce Hi • and/or HO •, which act as singly charged donors.[41,47] In In2O3:W,H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, decreases of N were observed at the crystallization temperatures. However, the magnitude of the decreases of N decreased with increasing Me contents. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), the N values of the crystallized In2O3:H ﬁlms were 1 1020–1.5 1020 cm3 because of the Hi • and/or HO • donors. As the Me content was increased to 0.39 at.%, the N values increased with a similar slope of the dotted line. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a gradual increase of the N values. These results demonstrate that W and Ce were activated as donors by the crystallization process even in the presence of hydrogen. By contrast, the N of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm deposited at 200 C was 3 1019 cm3. The free carriers are assumed to be generated from intrinsic defects, mainly from oxygen-vacancytype defects, as revealed in previous works.[34,44] When the ﬁlms were doped with low Me contents, the N values increased in Figure 6.

A further increase in the Ce/In ratio increased the N values although the values were below the dotted line. These results indicate that Wand Ce work as electron donors. The overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors. Notably, the H contents determined by TDS and hydrogen forward-scattering spectrometry (HFS) reveal that large amounts of hydrogen are present that do not contribute to the carrier generation. The hydrogen passivates acceptors[56] to reduce the carrier compensation because the In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited signiﬁcantly high μ, as described below. We here focus on the μ values of the ﬁlms. Figure 6(b) summarizes the relationship between N and μ measured at room temperature for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. At a glance, the μ values varied depending on the ﬁlm structure and fabrication processes: the a-In2O3:H and In2O3: Me,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 40–60 cm2 V1 s1, the polyIn2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 30–90 cm2 V1 s1 that strongly depended on Me, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce, H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 110–160 cm2 V1 s1, and the spcIn2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 80 cm2 V1 s1. In general, the mobility of polycrystalline TCO ﬁlms is dominated by scattering produced by GBs, stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including ionized and neutral impurities, and phonons.[51,52] To distinguish between the contributions of the various scattering sources, a comparison of the Hall and optical mobilities and measurements of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect are useful. The ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility reﬂects the effect of GB scattering: a ratio of 1 implies that GB scattering plays a negligible effect in the ﬁlms, whereas a ratio less than 1 implies that GB scattering inﬂuences the μ values, as explained in Section 1. When transport across GBs occurs mainly through thermionic emission instead of tunneling, the effect of GB scattering on the μ values increases with decreasing temperature.[51–53] This trend is also true for scattering induced by charged extended defects.[52] By contrast, scattering induced by ionized and neutral impurities is independent of temperature in a degenerately doped semiconductor, whereas phonon scattering becomes large with increasing temperature. From a previous analysis of spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms that exhibit transport properties similar to those shown in Figure 6, the Hall mobilities were equal to the optical mobilities,[47] suggesting that GB scattering plays a negligible effect and that intragrain properties limit the Hall mobilities in the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms. Figure 7 shows a plot of the data in Figure 5 for the spc-In2O3: H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms during the cooling process from 250 C to room temperature; the mobilities are plotted versus the corresponding carrier densities with temperature acting as parameter. The spc-In2O3:H and spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited i) a slight decrease in N with an increase in μ from 250 to 230 C and ii) a large increase in μ with a negligible change in N from 230 C to room temperature. The former result is explained by the desorption of H from the ﬁlms during heating under vacuum, whereas the latter result clearly suggests that phonon scattering dominates the ﬁlms’ μ values. The spcIn2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O and the spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O exhibited high μ values of 160 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature. The high μ values with N values of 1 1020–2 1020 cm3 cannot be quantitatively explained by the current models,[49] as described in Section 1. However, the μ values strongly suggest that scattering produced by neutral and doubly charged ionized impurities is negligible and that their mobilities are limited by singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •) and by phonon scattering.[49] Indeed, the dominant valence states of Ce have been reported to be 3þ and 4þ in In2O3:Ce,H and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms.[6] Conversely, the μ values for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O increased slowly with decreasing temperature and the ﬁlm exhibited lower μ values at room temperature than the ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O. Plausibly, charged extended and point defects within grains are present in the ﬁlm because of low H contents and/or H effusion from the ﬁlm during post-annealing. Indeed, decreases in both the Hall and the optical mobility were observed in spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms when the ﬁlms were postannealed at higher temperatures (400 C).[47] By contrast, the μ values of the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents increased and N decreased during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a large decrease of μ and a slight increase of N (Figure 6 and 7). These results imply that extensive Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) produced carrier scattering centers in addition to the singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •), leading to compensation of the free carriers, likely via the formation of defect complexes such as 2 CeIn •Oi00 in the ﬁlms. By contrast, spc-In2O3:W,H Figure 7. Variation of the carrier density (N) and mobility (μ) of spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films during cooling from 250 C to room temperature.

Because no large difference in the structure was detected between the spc-In2O3:W,H and spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms by XRD, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not shown here) analyses, the point defects within the grains that cannot be assessed by these characterization tools may be responsible for the low mobility. In addition, post-annealing of the poly-In2O3:W ﬁlm at 300 C increased the μ values to 110 cm2 V1 s1, much higher than the μ values of the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms, as will be shown later. The same post-annealing process was performed for the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms; however, the μ values of the ﬁlms did not increase (not shown here). Therefore, point defects associated with W and H or OH species may be responsible for the other scattering centers produced in the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms. With respect to the carrier scattering in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms, Figure 6(a) and (b) shows that the μ values of the polyIn2O3:Ce ﬁlms were much smaller than those of the corresponding spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms. To investigate the dominant scattering centers in the polycrystalline ﬁlms, we postannealed the ﬁlms at 300 C. The [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values varied from [1.7 1020, 82] to [1.7 1020, 110], from [1.1 1020, 70] to [1.1 1020, 96], from [1.5 1020, 81] to [1.5 1020, 100], and from [1.9 1020, 88] to [2.0 1020, 110] after the post-annealing process for the poly-In2O3:W, poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), poly-In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 2 wt.%), and poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. In all of the ﬁlms, μ values increased with a negligible change in N. The mobility improvement was not accompanied by a change of the structural properties, as revealed by XRD (not shown). Thus, no recrystallization occurred during the post-annealing process. However, the point and extended defect densities were plausibly reduced by the process. That is, the as-deposited poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms contained a large amount of point and extended defects because of the low-temperature deposition and their mobilities were limited largely by intragrain properties. Notably, a linear increase of μ values with increasing N in Figure 6(b) for the asdeposited poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms seems like a suggestion at a glance that the GB scattering strongly inﬂuences the μ values if we assume similar grain sizes and trap densities at GBs in the polycrystalline ﬁlms. However, the aforementioned changes in transport properties induced by post-annealing clearly suggest that the μ values in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms were limited by intragrain properties rather than by grain barriers. Finally, we discuss the role of solid-phase crystallization and H doping in the In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. The spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values greater than those of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms. In addition, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited increases in μ with negligible changes in N during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. These results suggest that solid-phase crystallization substantially reduced scattering by GBs and extended and point defects within grains. These ﬁndings are attributed to fewer lattice defects because of the use of solid-phase crystallization instead of low-temperature crystal growth by physical vapor deposition. This ﬁnding is supported by the structural properties explained in Section 2.1. By contrast, H doping increased N. As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6 (a), the overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,He ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors and by reduced carrier compensation through passivation of acceptors by hydrogen. Notably, the presence of hydrogen within the ﬁlms did not prevent activation of the Ce donors. However, further Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) resulted in saturation of N in conjunction with a decrease of μ. Conversely, W doping in In2O3:H apparently produced additional carrier scattering centers, as previously described. These results suggest that room may exist for further increasing N while maintaining a high μ by selecting appropriate metal dopants. 2.3. Optical Properties Figure 8 presents the optical constants for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, and (c) spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, as evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As observed in the extinction coefﬁcient (k) spectra, all of the ﬁlms were transparent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. In the longer-wavelength region (>1200 nm), k increased with increasing N because of free-carrier absorption. In addition, the refractive index (n) of the ﬁlms shifted toward lower values in the NIR region with increasing N, consistent with the Drude model. In the ultraviolet region, all of the ﬁlms exhibited strong absorption. Figure 9 shows the absorption coefﬁcients (α ¼ 4πk/λ) for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3: Me ﬁlms, and (c) spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms exhibited absorption onsets at 2.7–2.8 eV. The α values steeply increased to greater than 105 cm1 at photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV, and the absorption varied depending on the dopant species in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms. The absorption edges increased with increasing N (Figure 6(a)) in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms; this behavior is well explained by the Burstein–Moss shift. Next, we will consider the weaker absorption extending from the photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV to the onset energies of 2.7– 2.8 eV. In In2O3, a strong optical absorption at ca. 3.7 eV in the ultraviolet was assigned to a direct transition, whereas an onset of weaker optical absorption at ca. 2.6 eV was assigned to an indirect transition from the valence-band maximum (VBM) away from the Γ-point to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) at the Γ-point.[63] However, recent ﬁrst-principles calculations and photoemission spectroscopy have revealed that there is no nature of indirect transition.[64–66] Speciﬁcally, optical transitions at ca. 2.9 eV from the VBM to the CBM at the Γ-point are forbidden by the symmetry of the bixbyite crystal, whereas optical transitions at ca. 3.7 eV from the lower-lying valence-band states (0.8 eV below the VBM) to the CBM are parityallowed.[64] Figure 9(d) shows a plots of the α values of the ﬁlms as a function of the photon energy on a logarithmic scale. The spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm showed an α value much less than 103 cm1 at 3 eV and exhibited an absorption onset of 2.7– 2.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the α spectra of bulk In2O3 cystals,[63,67] suggesting high crystalline quality in the spc- status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

In addition, the onset energy reﬂects an indirect fundamental bandgap. The direct forbidden transitions weakly allowed away from the Γ-point may contribute to the absorption.[64–66] When compared with the spectra of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms, that of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited milder slopes; in addition, the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited a higher α value than the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm at 3 eV. Here, the slight shift of the α spectra along the horizontal axis is attributed to the difference in N values, as previously explained. The milder slope with higher α values reﬂects the existence of defect states in the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm. In addition, the structural disorder might weaken the selection rule of the direct forbidden transitions, giving rise to weak but non-negligible transitions. Furthermore, optical transitions that are forbidden by the selection rules could occur in the disordered structure of the a-In2O3:H ﬁlm, leading to α values much higher than those of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms. Notably, the spc-In2O3:W,H and poly-In2O3:W ﬁlms exhibited higher α values at 3 eV than other crystallized and polycrystalline ﬁlms, respectively, even though the W-doped ﬁlms exhibited crystallinity comparable to the other ﬁlms, as revealed by the SEM, XRD, and TEM analyses. The greater absorption in the W-doped ﬁlms may originate from W dstates.[68] 3. Conclusion Two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with mobilities substantially greater than that of ITO were recently reported. Poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibited mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures, and spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms fabricated at low temperatures exhibited mobilities greater 100 cm2 V1 s1. To determine the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and H codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms on glass substrates at 200 C and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms post-annealed at 250 C via RPD. The obtained [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values were [2.8 1019, 30], [1.5 1020, 90], [9.9 1019, 74], [1.4 1020, 85], and [1.8 1020, 94] for the poly-In2O3, In2O3:W (WO3: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively, whereas these values were [1.1 1020–1.5 1020, 140–160], [2.0 1020–2.4 1020, 82–84], [1.7 1020–2.1 1020, 140–160], [2.2 1020–2.4 1020, 130– 150], and [2.4 1020, 110–130] for the spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W, H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. The N values of the crystallized ﬁlms were 1 1020 cm3 higher than those of the corresponding ﬁlms, indicating that H doping produces 1 1020 cm3 free electrons. In addition, Ce and W doping increased the carrier density with increasing Me/In ratio in both spc-In2O3:Me,H and poly-In2O3:Me deposited at 200 C, suggesting that Ce and W function as electron donors and that the presence of H in the ﬁlms does not affect their carrier activation. Analysis of the N–μ and μ–temperature behaviors of the spc-In2O3:Me,H and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms strongly supported the hypothesis that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., Hi •, HO •, CeIn •) and that scattering induced by the ionized impurities and phonons dominated their μ values. Conversely, the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited a lower mobility of 80 cm2 V1 s1. The structural and electrical analyses and comparative studies between the spc-In2O3:W,H and polyIn2O3:W ﬁlms suggested the presence of point defects associated with W and H or OH species in the spc-In2O3:W, H ﬁlms. By contrast, poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce exhibited lower μ values than the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, respectively. Changes in the N and μ values after the post-annealing process indicated that the mobility of the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms was strongly limited by intragrain properties, i.e., scattering centers produced by stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects. Indeed, the SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the ﬁlms had small grains with abundant lattice defects, in sharp contrast to the case of crystallized ﬁlms with large grains with high crystallinity. Furthermore, the ﬁlms exhibited larger absorption tails at 3 eV compared with those of the crystallized ﬁlms. These results strongly suggest that the solid-phase crystallization process serves to substantially improve the intragrain properties. Furthermore, EBSD analysis revealed that the PH2O and the Me contents during deposition determined the density of the crystalline nuclei within the asdeposited amorphous ﬁlms and, thus, also determined the grain size of the crystallized ﬁlms. 4. Experimental Section Approximately 60-nm-thick and 220-nm-thick In2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrates and SiO2/Si substrates via RPD (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, URT-IP2).[69] We used ceramic tablets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) with different impurities: pure In2O3, In2O3 with a WO3 content of 1 wt.%, and In2O3 with CeO2 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.%. The deposition gases were Ar, O2, and H2O at a total pressure of 0.4 Pa. The flow ratio of O2 to Ar was fixed at 24%, whereas the PH2O was varied from 1 105 to 5 104 Pa before deposition monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (Inficon, Transpector XPR3). For the fabrication of the polyIn2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films, the films were deposited at 200 C. Here, we used the notation without H because the heated substrate and growth surface suppressed the incorporation of a large amount of hydrogen into the film, as described in Section 2.1. However, the a-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films were fabricated without intentional substrate heating. The maximum substrate temperatures were observed to be less than 60 C during deposition using thermolabels attached to the glass and SiO2/Si substrates. After deposition, some films were postannealed at 250 C under vacuum to obtain crystallized films. Most of the characterizations of the films were conducted using 220-nmthick films on glass. Hereafter, we describe the layer structure when the characterization was conducted using specimens other than 220-nm-thick films on glass. The hydrogen contents in the films were evaluated by HFS (CEA) and TDS (ESCO, EMD-1000S) using 220-nm-thick films on SiO2/Si substrates. The contents of metal impurities within the films were analyzed using ICP-MS (Agilent, 8900 ICP-QQQ). The surface morphology and crystallinity of the films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, S-4300) and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab), respectively. EBSD (JEOL, JSM-7001F) was used to evaluate the crystalline orientation of each grain at an electron acceleration voltage of 15keV. The ρ, N, and μ values of the films were determined from Hall measurements (Toyo, ResiTest8300) in van der Pauw configurations at roomtemperature. Thetemperaturedependenceoftheelectrical properties was also evaluated every 10 C from 40 to 250 C, with subsequent cooling from250 Ctoroomtemperature.Duringheating,thefilmscrystallized.The opticalconstantsofthefilmsweredeterminedbySE(J.A.Woolam,M-2000) using60-nm-thickfilmsonSiO2/Sisubstrates.Here,theopticalconstantsat each wavelength were mathematically derived by inverting the measured SE status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

High-mobility TCOs are needed to achieve high conductivity with improved visible and near-infrared transparency; however, the fabrication of TCO films on heat-sensitive layers or substrates is constrained by the trade-off between fabrication temperatures and TCO properties. Historically, Sn-doped indium oxide and amorphous In– Zn–O have been used as standard TCOs to achieve high mobility using low fabrication temperatures. However, two polycrystalline In2O3 films with significantly higher mobilities have recently been reported: i) polycrystalline (poly-) In2O3 films doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibit mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures and ii) solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) and In2O3:Ce,H films exhibit mobilities greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 when processed at low temperatures of 150–200 C. Here, poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films are fabricated. Comparative studies of these films reveal the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties. 1. Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms have been widely used as window electrodes in optoelectronic applications such as displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The continuous development of solar cells (e.g., thin-ﬁlm Si, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and Si-wafer-based heterojunction solar cells) has stimulated research on TCO ﬁlms (e.g., In2O3,[1–6] ZnO,[1,7–10] and SnO2 [11]). For example, high electron mobility is required for the TCO ﬁlms used in solar cells because a high-mobility results in a low sheet resistance at a low carrier density, providing high transparency with reduced free-carrier absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.[12–16] Low-temperature growth is also required because of the presence of temperature-sensitive layers in many solar cells (e.g., Si heterojunction,[17,18] Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2,[19,20] and perovskite[21,22] solar cells). Polycrystalline (poly-) Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)[23–25] and amorphous-In2O3-based TCOs (e.g., a-ITO[25,26] and a-In–Zn–O (a-IZO)[27,28]) have been broadly used to satisfy these requirements. Poly-ITO ﬁlms grown at temperatures below 200–300 C exhibit a high electron mobility (μ) of 40 cm2 V1 s1 with a low resistivity (ρ) of 1 104Ω cm,[29] whereas a-IZO ﬁlms deposited even at room temperature exhibit a high μ of 60 cm2 V1 s1 with a relatively low ρ of 3 104Ω cm.[30,31] Recently, two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with higher μ values have been reported. First, poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti,[1,32] Zr,[1,33,34] Mo,[1,35–39] or W[5,40]) impurities (In2O3:Me) instead of Sn exhibit μ values greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 at a carrier density (N) from 1 1020 to 3 1020 cm3. These ﬁlms are normally deposited onto heated substrates using various growth methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and ion plating with DC arc discharge, known as high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation or reactive plasma deposition (RPD)). Second, solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) ﬁlms exhibit μ values greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 with N values from 1 1020 to 2 1020 cm3 at low process temperatures from 150 to 200 C.[41] The ﬁlms are fabricated using a two-step growth process, speciﬁcally, the deposition of amorphous or amorphous-rich In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low temperatures via magnetron sputtering,[41] RPD,[42] or atomic layer deposition[43] and subsequently thermally annealed at a temperature greater than 150 C. During annealing, solid-phase crystallization occurs and high electron mobility is achieved. Similar properties have also been reported for CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 ﬁlms.[42] Notably, spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms on glass substrates fabricated at low process temperatures (200 C) exhibited higher μ values than Medoped epitaxial ﬁlms grown at high temperatures (600 C) on single-crystalline oxide substrates.[15,44,45] The mechanisms responsible for this high electron mobility have been investigated. Analysis of effective mass has been conducted as a function of N for various specimens, including Dr. T. Koida, Y. Ueno, Dr. H.

In In2O3:H ﬁlms, ab initio calculations revealed that interstitial H (Hi •) and substitutional H (HO •) function as singly charged donors, being energetically more favorable than an oxygen vacancy (VO ••).[55] Additionally, interstitial hydrogen atoms have been reported to passivate negatively charged acceptor-type cation vacancies.[56] Experimentally determined N and μ data have been evaluated on the basis of theoretical carrier scattering models and used to determine the doping mechanisms. The Hall mobility values agreed well with the calculated values dominated by singly charged impurities, which suggests that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, Hi •, HO •) rather than by doubly charged donors (e.g., VO ••) in In2O3:Me,[32,34,44] In2O3:H,[41] and In2O3:Ce,H.[42] However, the degenerately doped TCO ﬁlms exhibited higher electron mobility with constant N at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, indicating that the μ values measured at room temperature were limited not only by the ionized impurity scattering but also by phonon scattering.[34,41] Therefore, the good agreement of the values suggests imperfections of the modeled mobility. An extended model based on scatterings produced by phonon and ionized impurities has also been discussed.[49] Currently, the model cannot quantitatively explain the experimentally determined high μ values, especially at N values greater than 1 1019 cm3; however, a more in-depth understanding of acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering in these materials was achieved.[49,53,57] In this study, to clarify the commonalities and disparities between the two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with high μ, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms in the as-deposited state and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms and evaluated their structural, electrical, and optical properties. All of the ﬁlms were deposited using an RPD system, and the deposition conditions were ﬁxed as much as possible (except for variables such as the dopant species and concentrations, substrate temperatures, and H2O vapor pressures during growth) to minimize ﬂuctuations in ﬁlm properties as a consequence of changes in the experimental conditions. Comparative studies of these ﬁlms revealed the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resulting transport properties. Among the fabricated ﬁlms, the spc-In2O3:Ce,H exhibited the lowest ρ of 1.81 104 Ω cm with a μ of 154 cm2 V1 s1 and N of 2.24 1020 cm3. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Properties Table 1 summarizes the ratios of metal (W and Ce) to In determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the as-deposited In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms without substrate heating. In this analysis, the Cu and Mo impurity contents resulting from the RPD system were also measured to investigate their effect on the ﬁlms. The Cu, Mo, and Ce (W) concentrations in the In2O3:W,H (In2O3:Ce,H) ﬁlm were less than the lower detection limits (0.0036 at.% for Cu/In, 0.0024 at. % for Mo/In, 0.0016 at.% for Ce/In, and 0.0012 at.% for W/In) of the instrument. The W-to-In atomic ratio was 0.39 at.% in the In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, and the Ce-to-In ratios were 0.28, 0.96, and 1.3 at.% in the In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt. %) ﬁlms, respectively. Herein, we applied the same ratios in the post-annealed ﬁlms and the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C because tungsten oxides and cerium oxides did not effuse from the ﬁlms during annealing at 250 C, and the sticking coefﬁcients of W and Ce would not change signiﬁcantly at a substrate temperature of 200 C. Figure 1 plots the H contents in the ﬁlms as a function of the partial pressure of H2O (PH2O). The H contents systematically increased with increasing PH2O in the ﬁlms without substrate heating, whereas the values were below 0.5 at.% for the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The high PH2O of 2 104 to 3 104 Pa before the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me depositions originated from the degassing of H2O vapor from the areas around the heater in the RPD chamber.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis revealed that 10% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms deposited without substrate heating effused at temperatures as high as 250 C (not shown here), which is similar to the case of a-In2O3:H ﬁlms fabricated using magnetron sputtering.[47] Therefore, the H contents in the crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C did not substantially decrease compared with those in the as-deposited ﬁlms.[41,47] The same result was observed for the In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms; 9% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms effused at temperatures as high as 200 C, the growth temperature of the ﬁlms, indicating that most of the effusion originated from the bulk of the ﬁlms and not from adsorbates at the surface exposed to the atmosphere before the TDS characterization. Figure 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O. All of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited grain sizes of 50 nm. Conversely, all of the as-deposited In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms without substrate heating exhibited featureless structures with smooth surfaces because of the amorphous-phase formation (not shown here). After the post-annealing treatment at 250 C, the ﬁlms exhibited large grain structures. The grain size and shape were dependent on PH2O during deposition: the spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O exhibited only polygonal structures with larger grain sizes than the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, whereas the spcIn2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents deposited at low PH2O and all of the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O exhibited polygonal and ﬂower-like structures with substantially larger grains. Figure 3 presents the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the (a) glass substrate and poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and the as-deposited and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms deposited at PH2O of (b) 2 105 Pa and (c) 5 105 Pa. The XRD patterns do not show evidence of segregation of the tungsten oxides and cerium oxides in the In2O3:Me and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation of the <111> direction (Figure 3(a)). However, an increase in PH2O during deposition without substrate heating suppressed crystal growth. The as-deposited ﬁlms deposited at low PH2O (2 105 Pa) exhibited a very small 222 reﬂection with a broad peak originating from the amorphous structure (Figure 3(b)), whereas the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (5 105 Pa) exhibited amorphous structures without any diffraction peaks (Figure 3 (c)). After the post-annealing process, a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction was observed, especially for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)), indicating that small grains oriented in the <111> direction in the as-deposited ﬁlms acted as crystalline nuclei during the crystallization process. By contrast, a more randomly oriented structure was observed for the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high CeO2 contents (2 and 3 wt.%) deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)) and for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (Figure 3(c)). Figure 3 (d) plots d values of the 444 reﬂection (d444) for the ﬁlms shown in Figure 3(a)–(c). The d444 values of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms were larger than that of the In2O3 powders (d444 ¼ 0.1460 nm), indicating the formation of in-plane compressive strains in the ﬁlms. By contrast, those of the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H were nearly identical to that of the In2O3 powder, reﬂecting lessstrained ﬁlms. Furthermore, the crystallized ﬁlms exhibited smaller full-width at half-maximum values of the 222 reﬂection than the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C, indicating larger crystallite sizes and smaller strains in the ﬁlms. Notably, the large differences between the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms do not originate from the slight difference in fabrication temperatures (i.e., 200 C for the polycrystalline ﬁlms and 250 C for the solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms) but from the different ﬁlm-preparation methods.

Figure 4 presents (a) image quality maps and inverse pole ﬁgure maps along the (b) normal, (c) transverse, and (d) reference directions for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms deposited at (1) low and (2) high PH2O. Here, the image quality map shows the GB and strain contrast. As observed in Figure 4(b-1, c-1, d-1), most of the grains in the ﬁlm fabricated at low PH2O were oriented in the <111> direction normal to the surface with the <101> direction parallel to the surface. This result corresponds well to the θ–2θ pattern shown in Figure 3(b). In addition, a dark spot within each grain is observed in the image quality map (Figure 4(a-1)). The difference in contrast reﬂects the difference in crystalline quality, indicating that the dark spots correspond to the crystalline nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix, which were formed during deposition (Figure 3(b)). Hence, the map clearly suggests that the grain size (0.81 μm) of the post-annealed ﬁlm was determined by the density of the crystalline nuclei and that no new nuclei were formed during post-annealing. Conversely, the ﬁlm grown at high PH2O exhibited larger grain sizes Figure 2.

In contrast to Figure 4(a-1), Figure 4(a-2) shows no dark spots within the grains. In addition, the ﬁlm crystallized at higher temperatures than the ﬁlm grown at low PH2O, as will be explained in Section 2.2. Therefore, the formation of nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix would be well suppressed because of the high PH2O during deposition and crystalline nuclei would be formed during post-annealing. On the basis of these results, we discuss the crystal growth of these ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation in the <111> direction. Similar crystalline orientations have been observed in the XRD patterns of polyIn2O3 ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and without substrate heating at a very low PH2O of <5 106 Pa for ﬁlms prepared by magnetron sputtering.[41,45] Because the (111) surface energy is the lowest among the low-indexed surfaces in In2O3, including the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces,[58] the ﬁlms grown on glass would exhibit preferred orientation in the <111> direction. However, the introduction of larger amounts of Ce (CeO2: 2, 3 wt.%) and/ or H2O vapor prevented the preferred orientation (Figure 3(b) and (c)). According to crystal growth theory, a critical cluster size exists because of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the cluster to grow to become a nucleus. Therefore, the incorporation of Ce and H atoms or OH-related species at the growth front inﬂuences medium-range structures[59] in the amorphous ﬁlms with an increase in the barrier height, thereby leading to the formation of low-density nuclei with preferred orientation of the <111> direction and no nuclei within the amorphous matrix at low and high PH2O, respectively. Consequently, the post-annealed ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O exhibited a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction and random orientation, respectively. Here, in the latter ﬁlms, nucleation would be generated from nanoclusters with medium-range ordering and grow during post-annealing. The grain size of the ﬁlms deposited at high (low) PH2O was 5.5 μm (0.81 μm), which are far larger than that (0.44 μm) of the ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering.[47] This ﬁnding can be explained by the lower densities of crystalline nuclei in the Figure 3.

During heating, solid-phase crystallization occurred. In Figure 5(a), the as-deposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at high PH2O exhibited a constant N at temperatures below 180 C, indicating that the ﬁlm was a degenerately doped semiconductor. However, a large decrease in N combined with an increase in μ was clearly observed at 180–200 C. Previous XRD and SEM analyses for aIn2O3:H ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering revealed that crystallization proceeded at the temperatures at which the N and μ values varied.[47] Therefore, the change observed in Figure 5(a) originated from the increase in the volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the ﬁlm. Upon full crystallization, the ﬁlm exhibited a constant N at temperatures over the entire range and Figure 4.

In the asdeposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low PH2O, the change in N occurred at lower temperatures (130–150 C), which can be explained by the presence of abundant crystalline nuclei within the as-deposited ﬁlm described in Section 2.1, thereby leading to full crystallization at lower temperatures. This ﬁnding is also true for the a-In2O3:W,H and a-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with a small amount of Ce (Figure 5(b) and (c)). However, the temperature increased with increasing Ce content (Figure 5(c)–(e)): i.e., 160– 180 C (200–220 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, 180– 200 C (190–210 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 2 wt.%) ﬁlms, and 180–200 C (210–230 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low (high) PH2O. The Ce doping increased the crystallization temperature. As shown in Figure 5, all of the as-deposited ﬁlms exhibited higher N values when deposited at high PH2O. In general, the N of a-In2O3-based TCOs, including a-IZO, a-ITO, and a-In2O3:H, can be controlled by the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm.[59,61] Herein, only PH2O was varied; the O2 and Ar ﬂow rates were constant. Therefore, the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm increased with increasing PH2O because of the presence of H radicals and ions produced in the plasma during deposition. Here, we assume that the N values in the a-In2O3:H and a-In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms were basically determined by the oxygen stoichiometry Figure 5.

During heating to 250 C, solidphase crystallization occurred. status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

Figure 6(a) summarizes the ρ, N, and μ values as a function on the Me/In ratio for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solidphase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The dotted line in the middle panel of Figure 6(a) shows the expected N for which all the carriers are generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, WIn •••Oi00). As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), N of the amorphous ﬁlms did not increase with increasing Me/In ratio and instead decreased with increasing Ce/In ratio. The results clearly demonstrate that Me did not act as an electron donor in the amorphous phase and that Ce doping reduced the oxygen deﬁciency within the a-In2O3 matrix, likely because of the higher bond strength of Ce–O than In–O. Moreover, the μ values decreased with increasing Ce content, indicating that Ce atoms act as scattering centers for free electrons in the amorphous structure. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon crystallization of the In2O3:H layer, N decreased with a large increase in μ. In addition, the slope of mobility as a function of temperature increased after crystallization. These results suggest a change in the carrier generation and scattering mechanisms. In previous works, we proposed that structural rearrangements during crystallization eliminate oxygen-vacancy-type defects with a large scattering cross section and produce Hi • and/or HO •, which act as singly charged donors.[41,47] In In2O3:W,H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, decreases of N were observed at the crystallization temperatures. However, the magnitude of the decreases of N decreased with increasing Me contents. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), the N values of the crystallized In2O3:H ﬁlms were 1 1020–1.5 1020 cm3 because of the Hi • and/or HO • donors. As the Me content was increased to 0.39 at.%, the N values increased with a similar slope of the dotted line. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a gradual increase of the N values. These results demonstrate that W and Ce were activated as donors by the crystallization process even in the presence of hydrogen. By contrast, the N of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm deposited at 200 C was 3 1019 cm3. The free carriers are assumed to be generated from intrinsic defects, mainly from oxygen-vacancytype defects, as revealed in previous works.[34,44] When the ﬁlms were doped with low Me contents, the N values increased in Figure 6.

A further increase in the Ce/In ratio increased the N values although the values were below the dotted line. These results indicate that Wand Ce work as electron donors. The overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors. Notably, the H contents determined by TDS and hydrogen forward-scattering spectrometry (HFS) reveal that large amounts of hydrogen are present that do not contribute to the carrier generation. The hydrogen passivates acceptors[56] to reduce the carrier compensation because the In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited signiﬁcantly high μ, as described below. We here focus on the μ values of the ﬁlms. Figure 6(b) summarizes the relationship between N and μ measured at room temperature for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. At a glance, the μ values varied depending on the ﬁlm structure and fabrication processes: the a-In2O3:H and In2O3: Me,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 40–60 cm2 V1 s1, the polyIn2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 30–90 cm2 V1 s1 that strongly depended on Me, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce, H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 110–160 cm2 V1 s1, and the spcIn2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 80 cm2 V1 s1. In general, the mobility of polycrystalline TCO ﬁlms is dominated by scattering produced by GBs, stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including ionized and neutral impurities, and phonons.[51,52] To distinguish between the contributions of the various scattering sources, a comparison of the Hall and optical mobilities and measurements of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect are useful. The ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility reﬂects the effect of GB scattering: a ratio of 1 implies that GB scattering plays a negligible effect in the ﬁlms, whereas a ratio less than 1 implies that GB scattering inﬂuences the μ values, as explained in Section 1. When transport across GBs occurs mainly through thermionic emission instead of tunneling, the effect of GB scattering on the μ values increases with decreasing temperature.[51–53] This trend is also true for scattering induced by charged extended defects.[52] By contrast, scattering induced by ionized and neutral impurities is independent of temperature in a degenerately doped semiconductor, whereas phonon scattering becomes large with increasing temperature. From a previous analysis of spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms that exhibit transport properties similar to those shown in Figure 6, the Hall mobilities were equal to the optical mobilities,[47] suggesting that GB scattering plays a negligible effect and that intragrain properties limit the Hall mobilities in the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms. Figure 7 shows a plot of the data in Figure 5 for the spc-In2O3: H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms during the cooling process from 250 C to room temperature; the mobilities are plotted versus the corresponding carrier densities with temperature acting as parameter. The spc-In2O3:H and spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited i) a slight decrease in N with an increase in μ from 250 to 230 C and ii) a large increase in μ with a negligible change in N from 230 C to room temperature. The former result is explained by the desorption of H from the ﬁlms during heating under vacuum, whereas the latter result clearly suggests that phonon scattering dominates the ﬁlms’ μ values. The spcIn2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O and the spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O exhibited high μ values of 160 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature. The high μ values with N values of 1 1020–2 1020 cm3 cannot be quantitatively explained by the current models,[49] as described in Section 1. However, the μ values strongly suggest that scattering produced by neutral and doubly charged ionized impurities is negligible and that their mobilities are limited by singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •) and by phonon scattering.[49] Indeed, the dominant valence states of Ce have been reported to be 3þ and 4þ in In2O3:Ce,H and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms.[6] Conversely, the μ values for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O increased slowly with decreasing temperature and the ﬁlm exhibited lower μ values at room temperature than the ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O. Plausibly, charged extended and point defects within grains are present in the ﬁlm because of low H contents and/or H effusion from the ﬁlm during post-annealing. Indeed, decreases in both the Hall and the optical mobility were observed in spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms when the ﬁlms were postannealed at higher temperatures (400 C).[47] By contrast, the μ values of the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents increased and N decreased during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a large decrease of μ and a slight increase of N (Figure 6 and 7). These results imply that extensive Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) produced carrier scattering centers in addition to the singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •), leading to compensation of the free carriers, likely via the formation of defect complexes such as 2 CeIn •Oi00 in the ﬁlms. By contrast, spc-In2O3:W,H Figure 7. Variation of the carrier density (N) and mobility (μ) of spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films during cooling from 250 C to room temperature.

Because no large difference in the structure was detected between the spc-In2O3:W,H and spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms by XRD, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not shown here) analyses, the point defects within the grains that cannot be assessed by these characterization tools may be responsible for the low mobility. In addition, post-annealing of the poly-In2O3:W ﬁlm at 300 C increased the μ values to 110 cm2 V1 s1, much higher than the μ values of the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms, as will be shown later. The same post-annealing process was performed for the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms; however, the μ values of the ﬁlms did not increase (not shown here). Therefore, point defects associated with W and H or OH species may be responsible for the other scattering centers produced in the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms. With respect to the carrier scattering in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms, Figure 6(a) and (b) shows that the μ values of the polyIn2O3:Ce ﬁlms were much smaller than those of the corresponding spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms. To investigate the dominant scattering centers in the polycrystalline ﬁlms, we postannealed the ﬁlms at 300 C. The [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values varied from [1.7 1020, 82] to [1.7 1020, 110], from [1.1 1020, 70] to [1.1 1020, 96], from [1.5 1020, 81] to [1.5 1020, 100], and from [1.9 1020, 88] to [2.0 1020, 110] after the post-annealing process for the poly-In2O3:W, poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), poly-In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 2 wt.%), and poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. In all of the ﬁlms, μ values increased with a negligible change in N. The mobility improvement was not accompanied by a change of the structural properties, as revealed by XRD (not shown). Thus, no recrystallization occurred during the post-annealing process. However, the point and extended defect densities were plausibly reduced by the process. That is, the as-deposited poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms contained a large amount of point and extended defects because of the low-temperature deposition and their mobilities were limited largely by intragrain properties. Notably, a linear increase of μ values with increasing N in Figure 6(b) for the asdeposited poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms seems like a suggestion at a glance that the GB scattering strongly inﬂuences the μ values if we assume similar grain sizes and trap densities at GBs in the polycrystalline ﬁlms. However, the aforementioned changes in transport properties induced by post-annealing clearly suggest that the μ values in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms were limited by intragrain properties rather than by grain barriers. Finally, we discuss the role of solid-phase crystallization and H doping in the In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. The spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values greater than those of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms. In addition, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited increases in μ with negligible changes in N during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. These results suggest that solid-phase crystallization substantially reduced scattering by GBs and extended and point defects within grains. These ﬁndings are attributed to fewer lattice defects because of the use of solid-phase crystallization instead of low-temperature crystal growth by physical vapor deposition. This ﬁnding is supported by the structural properties explained in Section 2.1. By contrast, H doping increased N. As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6 (a), the overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,He ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors and by reduced carrier compensation through passivation of acceptors by hydrogen. Notably, the presence of hydrogen within the ﬁlms did not prevent activation of the Ce donors. However, further Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) resulted in saturation of N in conjunction with a decrease of μ. Conversely, W doping in In2O3:H apparently produced additional carrier scattering centers, as previously described. These results suggest that room may exist for further increasing N while maintaining a high μ by selecting appropriate metal dopants. 2.3. Optical Properties Figure 8 presents the optical constants for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, and (c) spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, as evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As observed in the extinction coefﬁcient (k) spectra, all of the ﬁlms were transparent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. In the longer-wavelength region (>1200 nm), k increased with increasing N because of free-carrier absorption. In addition, the refractive index (n) of the ﬁlms shifted toward lower values in the NIR region with increasing N, consistent with the Drude model. In the ultraviolet region, all of the ﬁlms exhibited strong absorption. Figure 9 shows the absorption coefﬁcients (α ¼ 4πk/λ) for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3: Me ﬁlms, and (c) spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms exhibited absorption onsets at 2.7–2.8 eV. The α values steeply increased to greater than 105 cm1 at photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV, and the absorption varied depending on the dopant species in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms. The absorption edges increased with increasing N (Figure 6(a)) in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms; this behavior is well explained by the Burstein–Moss shift. Next, we will consider the weaker absorption extending from the photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV to the onset energies of 2.7– 2.8 eV. In In2O3, a strong optical absorption at ca. 3.7 eV in the ultraviolet was assigned to a direct transition, whereas an onset of weaker optical absorption at ca. 2.6 eV was assigned to an indirect transition from the valence-band maximum (VBM) away from the Γ-point to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) at the Γ-point.[63] However, recent ﬁrst-principles calculations and photoemission spectroscopy have revealed that there is no nature of indirect transition.[64–66] Speciﬁcally, optical transitions at ca. 2.9 eV from the VBM to the CBM at the Γ-point are forbidden by the symmetry of the bixbyite crystal, whereas optical transitions at ca. 3.7 eV from the lower-lying valence-band states (0.8 eV below the VBM) to the CBM are parityallowed.[64] Figure 9(d) shows a plots of the α values of the ﬁlms as a function of the photon energy on a logarithmic scale. The spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm showed an α value much less than 103 cm1 at 3 eV and exhibited an absorption onset of 2.7– 2.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the α spectra of bulk In2O3 cystals,[63,67] suggesting high crystalline quality in the spc- status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

In addition, the onset energy reﬂects an indirect fundamental bandgap. The direct forbidden transitions weakly allowed away from the Γ-point may contribute to the absorption.[64–66] When compared with the spectra of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms, that of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited milder slopes; in addition, the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited a higher α value than the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm at 3 eV. Here, the slight shift of the α spectra along the horizontal axis is attributed to the difference in N values, as previously explained. The milder slope with higher α values reﬂects the existence of defect states in the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm. In addition, the structural disorder might weaken the selection rule of the direct forbidden transitions, giving rise to weak but non-negligible transitions. Furthermore, optical transitions that are forbidden by the selection rules could occur in the disordered structure of the a-In2O3:H ﬁlm, leading to α values much higher than those of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms. Notably, the spc-In2O3:W,H and poly-In2O3:W ﬁlms exhibited higher α values at 3 eV than other crystallized and polycrystalline ﬁlms, respectively, even though the W-doped ﬁlms exhibited crystallinity comparable to the other ﬁlms, as revealed by the SEM, XRD, and TEM analyses. The greater absorption in the W-doped ﬁlms may originate from W dstates.[68] 3. Conclusion Two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with mobilities substantially greater than that of ITO were recently reported. Poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibited mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures, and spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms fabricated at low temperatures exhibited mobilities greater 100 cm2 V1 s1. To determine the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and H codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms on glass substrates at 200 C and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms post-annealed at 250 C via RPD. The obtained [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values were [2.8 1019, 30], [1.5 1020, 90], [9.9 1019, 74], [1.4 1020, 85], and [1.8 1020, 94] for the poly-In2O3, In2O3:W (WO3: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively, whereas these values were [1.1 1020–1.5 1020, 140–160], [2.0 1020–2.4 1020, 82–84], [1.7 1020–2.1 1020, 140–160], [2.2 1020–2.4 1020, 130– 150], and [2.4 1020, 110–130] for the spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W, H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. The N values of the crystallized ﬁlms were 1 1020 cm3 higher than those of the corresponding ﬁlms, indicating that H doping produces 1 1020 cm3 free electrons. In addition, Ce and W doping increased the carrier density with increasing Me/In ratio in both spc-In2O3:Me,H and poly-In2O3:Me deposited at 200 C, suggesting that Ce and W function as electron donors and that the presence of H in the ﬁlms does not affect their carrier activation. Analysis of the N–μ and μ–temperature behaviors of the spc-In2O3:Me,H and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms strongly supported the hypothesis that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., Hi •, HO •, CeIn •) and that scattering induced by the ionized impurities and phonons dominated their μ values. Conversely, the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited a lower mobility of 80 cm2 V1 s1. The structural and electrical analyses and comparative studies between the spc-In2O3:W,H and polyIn2O3:W ﬁlms suggested the presence of point defects associated with W and H or OH species in the spc-In2O3:W, H ﬁlms. By contrast, poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce exhibited lower μ values than the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, respectively. Changes in the N and μ values after the post-annealing process indicated that the mobility of the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms was strongly limited by intragrain properties, i.e., scattering centers produced by stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects. Indeed, the SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the ﬁlms had small grains with abundant lattice defects, in sharp contrast to the case of crystallized ﬁlms with large grains with high crystallinity. Furthermore, the ﬁlms exhibited larger absorption tails at 3 eV compared with those of the crystallized ﬁlms. These results strongly suggest that the solid-phase crystallization process serves to substantially improve the intragrain properties. Furthermore, EBSD analysis revealed that the PH2O and the Me contents during deposition determined the density of the crystalline nuclei within the asdeposited amorphous ﬁlms and, thus, also determined the grain size of the crystallized ﬁlms. 4. Experimental Section Approximately 60-nm-thick and 220-nm-thick In2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrates and SiO2/Si substrates via RPD (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, URT-IP2).[69] We used ceramic tablets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) with different impurities: pure In2O3, In2O3 with a WO3 content of 1 wt.%, and In2O3 with CeO2 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.%. The deposition gases were Ar, O2, and H2O at a total pressure of 0.4 Pa. The flow ratio of O2 to Ar was fixed at 24%, whereas the PH2O was varied from 1 105 to 5 104 Pa before deposition monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (Inficon, Transpector XPR3). For the fabrication of the polyIn2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films, the films were deposited at 200 C. Here, we used the notation without H because the heated substrate and growth surface suppressed the incorporation of a large amount of hydrogen into the film, as described in Section 2.1. However, the a-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films were fabricated without intentional substrate heating. The maximum substrate temperatures were observed to be less than 60 C during deposition using thermolabels attached to the glass and SiO2/Si substrates. After deposition, some films were postannealed at 250 C under vacuum to obtain crystallized films. Most of the characterizations of the films were conducted using 220-nmthick films on glass. Hereafter, we describe the layer structure when the characterization was conducted using specimens other than 220-nm-thick films on glass. The hydrogen contents in the films were evaluated by HFS (CEA) and TDS (ESCO, EMD-1000S) using 220-nm-thick films on SiO2/Si substrates. The contents of metal impurities within the films were analyzed using ICP-MS (Agilent, 8900 ICP-QQQ). The surface morphology and crystallinity of the films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, S-4300) and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab), respectively. EBSD (JEOL, JSM-7001F) was used to evaluate the crystalline orientation of each grain at an electron acceleration voltage of 15keV. The ρ, N, and μ values of the films were determined from Hall measurements (Toyo, ResiTest8300) in van der Pauw configurations at roomtemperature. Thetemperaturedependenceoftheelectrical properties was also evaluated every 10 C from 40 to 250 C, with subsequent cooling from250 Ctoroomtemperature.Duringheating,thefilmscrystallized.The opticalconstantsofthefilmsweredeterminedbySE(J.A.Woolam,M-2000) using60-nm-thickfilmsonSiO2/Sisubstrates.Here,theopticalconstantsat each wavelength were mathematically derived by inverting the measured SE status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

High-mobility TCOs are needed to achieve high conductivity with improved visible and near-infrared transparency; however, the fabrication of TCO films on heat-sensitive layers or substrates is constrained by the trade-off between fabrication temperatures and TCO properties. Historically, Sn-doped indium oxide and amorphous In– Zn–O have been used as standard TCOs to achieve high mobility using low fabrication temperatures. However, two polycrystalline In2O3 films with significantly higher mobilities have recently been reported: i) polycrystalline (poly-) In2O3 films doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibit mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures and ii) solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) and In2O3:Ce,H films exhibit mobilities greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 when processed at low temperatures of 150–200 C. Here, poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films are fabricated. Comparative studies of these films reveal the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties. 1. Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms have been widely used as window electrodes in optoelectronic applications such as displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The continuous development of solar cells (e.g., thin-ﬁlm Si, chalcopyrite, organic, perovskite, and Si-wafer-based heterojunction solar cells) has stimulated research on TCO ﬁlms (e.g., In2O3,[1–6] ZnO,[1,7–10] and SnO2 [11]). For example, high electron mobility is required for the TCO ﬁlms used in solar cells because a high-mobility results in a low sheet resistance at a low carrier density, providing high transparency with reduced free-carrier absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.[12–16] Low-temperature growth is also required because of the presence of temperature-sensitive layers in many solar cells (e.g., Si heterojunction,[17,18] Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2,[19,20] and perovskite[21,22] solar cells). Polycrystalline (poly-) Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO)[23–25] and amorphous-In2O3-based TCOs (e.g., a-ITO[25,26] and a-In–Zn–O (a-IZO)[27,28]) have been broadly used to satisfy these requirements. Poly-ITO ﬁlms grown at temperatures below 200–300 C exhibit a high electron mobility (μ) of 40 cm2 V1 s1 with a low resistivity (ρ) of 1 104Ω cm,[29] whereas a-IZO ﬁlms deposited even at room temperature exhibit a high μ of 60 cm2 V1 s1 with a relatively low ρ of 3 104Ω cm.[30,31] Recently, two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with higher μ values have been reported. First, poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti,[1,32] Zr,[1,33,34] Mo,[1,35–39] or W[5,40]) impurities (In2O3:Me) instead of Sn exhibit μ values greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 at a carrier density (N) from 1 1020 to 3 1020 cm3. These ﬁlms are normally deposited onto heated substrates using various growth methods (e.g., magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and ion plating with DC arc discharge, known as high-density plasma-enhanced evaporation or reactive plasma deposition (RPD)). Second, solid-phase crystallized (spc-) H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) ﬁlms exhibit μ values greater than 100 cm2 V1 s1 with N values from 1 1020 to 2 1020 cm3 at low process temperatures from 150 to 200 C.[41] The ﬁlms are fabricated using a two-step growth process, speciﬁcally, the deposition of amorphous or amorphous-rich In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low temperatures via magnetron sputtering,[41] RPD,[42] or atomic layer deposition[43] and subsequently thermally annealed at a temperature greater than 150 C. During annealing, solid-phase crystallization occurs and high electron mobility is achieved. Similar properties have also been reported for CeO2 and hydrogen co-doped In2O3 ﬁlms.[42] Notably, spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms on glass substrates fabricated at low process temperatures (200 C) exhibited higher μ values than Medoped epitaxial ﬁlms grown at high temperatures (600 C) on single-crystalline oxide substrates.[15,44,45] The mechanisms responsible for this high electron mobility have been investigated. Analysis of effective mass has been conducted as a function of N for various specimens, including Dr. T. Koida, Y. Ueno, Dr. H.

KGaA, Weinheim 1700506 (1 of 14) polycrystalline and epitaxial ﬁlms and bulk single crystals, to determine the curvature of the energy band as a function of the Fermi energy.[38,40,46–50] High-μ TCO ﬁlms exhibited an electron effective mass similar to those of conventional poly-ITO and aIn2O3-based TCO ﬁlms, indicating that high μ is achieved through a larger relaxation time rather than a smaller effective mass.[47,49] In polycrystalline ﬁlms, the overall relaxation time is determined by scattering induced by grain boundaries (GBs), stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including neutral and ionized impurities, and phonons.[51,52] The effect of GB scattering can be evaluated from the ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility: Hall mobilities are affected by GB scattering when electrons transport across GBs, whereas optical mobilities are not affected by GBs because free electrons exist inside grains and because the amplitude of oscillation of an electron under the inﬂuence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the grain sizes in typical TCO ﬁlms.[13] In the spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms, the effect of GBs was found to be minor because these ﬁlms’ optical mobilities were comparable to their Hall mobilities.[47] Furthermore, the effects of dopant species (Me and H) on the grain-barrier height and resulting transport properties in polycrystalline ﬁlms have also been discussed.[53] With respect to intragrain properties, suppressed scattering from oxygen interstitials[36,39,40] originating from the formation of the singly charged donor (e.g., MoIn •••Oi00, WIn •••Oi00) and suppressed scattering from defects related to oxygen deﬁciencies[34,42,44,54] originating from the introduction of metals with higher bond strength with O than In and Sn in the In2O3 host material have been discussed. In In2O3:H ﬁlms, ab initio calculations revealed that interstitial H (Hi •) and substitutional H (HO •) function as singly charged donors, being energetically more favorable than an oxygen vacancy (VO ••).[55] Additionally, interstitial hydrogen atoms have been reported to passivate negatively charged acceptor-type cation vacancies.[56] Experimentally determined N and μ data have been evaluated on the basis of theoretical carrier scattering models and used to determine the doping mechanisms. The Hall mobility values agreed well with the calculated values dominated by singly charged impurities, which suggests that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, Hi •, HO •) rather than by doubly charged donors (e.g., VO ••) in In2O3:Me,[32,34,44] In2O3:H,[41] and In2O3:Ce,H.[42] However, the degenerately doped TCO ﬁlms exhibited higher electron mobility with constant N at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, indicating that the μ values measured at room temperature were limited not only by the ionized impurity scattering but also by phonon scattering.[34,41] Therefore, the good agreement of the values suggests imperfections of the modeled mobility. An extended model based on scatterings produced by phonon and ionized impurities has also been discussed.[49] Currently, the model cannot quantitatively explain the experimentally determined high μ values, especially at N values greater than 1 1019 cm3; however, a more in-depth understanding of acoustic deformation potential scattering, polar optical phonon scattering, and ionized impurity scattering in these materials was achieved.[49,53,57] In this study, to clarify the commonalities and disparities between the two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with high μ, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms in the as-deposited state and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms and evaluated their structural, electrical, and optical properties. All of the ﬁlms were deposited using an RPD system, and the deposition conditions were ﬁxed as much as possible (except for variables such as the dopant species and concentrations, substrate temperatures, and H2O vapor pressures during growth) to minimize ﬂuctuations in ﬁlm properties as a consequence of changes in the experimental conditions. Comparative studies of these ﬁlms revealed the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and hydrogen codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resulting transport properties. Among the fabricated ﬁlms, the spc-In2O3:Ce,H exhibited the lowest ρ of 1.81 104 Ω cm with a μ of 154 cm2 V1 s1 and N of 2.24 1020 cm3. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Structural Properties Table 1 summarizes the ratios of metal (W and Ce) to In determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis for the as-deposited In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms without substrate heating. In this analysis, the Cu and Mo impurity contents resulting from the RPD system were also measured to investigate their effect on the ﬁlms. The Cu, Mo, and Ce (W) concentrations in the In2O3:W,H (In2O3:Ce,H) ﬁlm were less than the lower detection limits (0.0036 at.% for Cu/In, 0.0024 at. % for Mo/In, 0.0016 at.% for Ce/In, and 0.0012 at.% for W/In) of the instrument. The W-to-In atomic ratio was 0.39 at.% in the In2O3:W,H (WO3: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, and the Ce-to-In ratios were 0.28, 0.96, and 1.3 at.% in the In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt. %) ﬁlms, respectively. Herein, we applied the same ratios in the post-annealed ﬁlms and the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C because tungsten oxides and cerium oxides did not effuse from the ﬁlms during annealing at 250 C, and the sticking coefﬁcients of W and Ce would not change signiﬁcantly at a substrate temperature of 200 C. Figure 1 plots the H contents in the ﬁlms as a function of the partial pressure of H2O (PH2O). The H contents systematically increased with increasing PH2O in the ﬁlms without substrate heating, whereas the values were below 0.5 at.% for the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The high PH2O of 2 104 to 3 104 Pa before the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me depositions originated from the degassing of H2O vapor from the areas around the heater in the RPD chamber.

Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis revealed that 10% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms deposited without substrate heating effused at temperatures as high as 250 C (not shown here), which is similar to the case of a-In2O3:H ﬁlms fabricated using magnetron sputtering.[47] Therefore, the H contents in the crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C did not substantially decrease compared with those in the as-deposited ﬁlms.[41,47] The same result was observed for the In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms; 9% of the total H contents in the ﬁlms effused at temperatures as high as 200 C, the growth temperature of the ﬁlms, indicating that most of the effusion originated from the bulk of the ﬁlms and not from adsorbates at the surface exposed to the atmosphere before the TDS characterization. Figure 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O. All of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited grain sizes of 50 nm. Conversely, all of the as-deposited In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms without substrate heating exhibited featureless structures with smooth surfaces because of the amorphous-phase formation (not shown here). After the post-annealing treatment at 250 C, the ﬁlms exhibited large grain structures. The grain size and shape were dependent on PH2O during deposition: the spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O exhibited only polygonal structures with larger grain sizes than the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, whereas the spcIn2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents deposited at low PH2O and all of the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O exhibited polygonal and ﬂower-like structures with substantially larger grains. Figure 3 presents the θ–2θ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the (a) glass substrate and poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and the as-deposited and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms deposited at PH2O of (b) 2 105 Pa and (c) 5 105 Pa. The XRD patterns do not show evidence of segregation of the tungsten oxides and cerium oxides in the In2O3:Me and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation of the <111> direction (Figure 3(a)). However, an increase in PH2O during deposition without substrate heating suppressed crystal growth. The as-deposited ﬁlms deposited at low PH2O (2 105 Pa) exhibited a very small 222 reﬂection with a broad peak originating from the amorphous structure (Figure 3(b)), whereas the ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (5 105 Pa) exhibited amorphous structures without any diffraction peaks (Figure 3 (c)). After the post-annealing process, a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction was observed, especially for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms with low Me contents deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)), indicating that small grains oriented in the <111> direction in the as-deposited ﬁlms acted as crystalline nuclei during the crystallization process. By contrast, a more randomly oriented structure was observed for the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high CeO2 contents (2 and 3 wt.%) deposited at low PH2O (Figure 3(b)) and for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms deposited at high PH2O (Figure 3(c)). Figure 3 (d) plots d values of the 444 reﬂection (d444) for the ﬁlms shown in Figure 3(a)–(c). The d444 values of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms were larger than that of the In2O3 powders (d444 ¼ 0.1460 nm), indicating the formation of in-plane compressive strains in the ﬁlms. By contrast, those of the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H were nearly identical to that of the In2O3 powder, reﬂecting lessstrained ﬁlms. Furthermore, the crystallized ﬁlms exhibited smaller full-width at half-maximum values of the 222 reﬂection than the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C, indicating larger crystallite sizes and smaller strains in the ﬁlms. Notably, the large differences between the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms do not originate from the slight difference in fabrication temperatures (i.e., 200 C for the polycrystalline ﬁlms and 250 C for the solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms) but from the different ﬁlm-preparation methods.

Here, the image quality map shows the GB and strain contrast. As observed in Figure 4(b-1, c-1, d-1), most of the grains in the ﬁlm fabricated at low PH2O were oriented in the <111> direction normal to the surface with the <101> direction parallel to the surface. This result corresponds well to the θ–2θ pattern shown in Figure 3(b). In addition, a dark spot within each grain is observed in the image quality map (Figure 4(a-1)). The difference in contrast reﬂects the difference in crystalline quality, indicating that the dark spots correspond to the crystalline nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix, which were formed during deposition (Figure 3(b)). Hence, the map clearly suggests that the grain size (0.81 μm) of the post-annealed ﬁlm was determined by the density of the crystalline nuclei and that no new nuclei were formed during post-annealing. Conversely, the ﬁlm grown at high PH2O exhibited larger grain sizes Figure 2.

In contrast to Figure 4(a-1), Figure 4(a-2) shows no dark spots within the grains. In addition, the ﬁlm crystallized at higher temperatures than the ﬁlm grown at low PH2O, as will be explained in Section 2.2. Therefore, the formation of nuclei embedded in the amorphous matrix would be well suppressed because of the high PH2O during deposition and crystalline nuclei would be formed during post-annealing. On the basis of these results, we discuss the crystal growth of these ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms deposited at 200 C exhibited preferred orientation in the <111> direction. Similar crystalline orientations have been observed in the XRD patterns of polyIn2O3 ﬁlms deposited at 200 C and without substrate heating at a very low PH2O of <5 106 Pa for ﬁlms prepared by magnetron sputtering.[41,45] Because the (111) surface energy is the lowest among the low-indexed surfaces in In2O3, including the (100), (110), and (111) surfaces,[58] the ﬁlms grown on glass would exhibit preferred orientation in the <111> direction. However, the introduction of larger amounts of Ce (CeO2: 2, 3 wt.%) and/ or H2O vapor prevented the preferred orientation (Figure 3(b) and (c)). According to crystal growth theory, a critical cluster size exists because of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the cluster to grow to become a nucleus. Therefore, the incorporation of Ce and H atoms or OH-related species at the growth front inﬂuences medium-range structures[59] in the amorphous ﬁlms with an increase in the barrier height, thereby leading to the formation of low-density nuclei with preferred orientation of the <111> direction and no nuclei within the amorphous matrix at low and high PH2O, respectively. Consequently, the post-annealed ﬁlms deposited at low and high PH2O exhibited a slight preferred orientation of the <111> direction and random orientation, respectively. Here, in the latter ﬁlms, nucleation would be generated from nanoclusters with medium-range ordering and grow during post-annealing. The grain size of the ﬁlms deposited at high (low) PH2O was 5.5 μm (0.81 μm), which are far larger than that (0.44 μm) of the ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering.[47] This ﬁnding can be explained by the lower densities of crystalline nuclei in the Figure 3.

The electrical properties of the ﬁlms were measured during heating from 40 to 250 C and subsequent cooling from 250 C to room temperature under vacuum. During heating, solid-phase crystallization occurred. In Figure 5(a), the as-deposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at high PH2O exhibited a constant N at temperatures below 180 C, indicating that the ﬁlm was a degenerately doped semiconductor. However, a large decrease in N combined with an increase in μ was clearly observed at 180–200 C. Previous XRD and SEM analyses for aIn2O3:H ﬁlms deposited via magnetron sputtering revealed that crystallization proceeded at the temperatures at which the N and μ values varied.[47] Therefore, the change observed in Figure 5(a) originated from the increase in the volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the ﬁlm. Upon full crystallization, the ﬁlm exhibited a constant N at temperatures over the entire range and Figure 4.

In the asdeposited a-In2O3:H ﬁlms grown at low PH2O, the change in N occurred at lower temperatures (130–150 C), which can be explained by the presence of abundant crystalline nuclei within the as-deposited ﬁlm described in Section 2.1, thereby leading to full crystallization at lower temperatures. This ﬁnding is also true for the a-In2O3:W,H and a-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with a small amount of Ce (Figure 5(b) and (c)). However, the temperature increased with increasing Ce content (Figure 5(c)–(e)): i.e., 160– 180 C (200–220 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms, 180– 200 C (190–210 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 2 wt.%) ﬁlms, and 180–200 C (210–230 C) for In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms deposited at low (high) PH2O. The Ce doping increased the crystallization temperature. As shown in Figure 5, all of the as-deposited ﬁlms exhibited higher N values when deposited at high PH2O. In general, the N of a-In2O3-based TCOs, including a-IZO, a-ITO, and a-In2O3:H, can be controlled by the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm.[59,61] Herein, only PH2O was varied; the O2 and Ar ﬂow rates were constant. Therefore, the oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm increased with increasing PH2O because of the presence of H radicals and ions produced in the plasma during deposition. Here, we assume that the N values in the a-In2O3:H and a-In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms were basically determined by the oxygen stoichiometry Figure 5.

Figure 6(a) summarizes the ρ, N, and μ values as a function on the Me/In ratio for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solidphase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. The dotted line in the middle panel of Figure 6(a) shows the expected N for which all the carriers are generated by singly charged donors (e.g., MeIn •, WIn •••Oi00). As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), N of the amorphous ﬁlms did not increase with increasing Me/In ratio and instead decreased with increasing Ce/In ratio. The results clearly demonstrate that Me did not act as an electron donor in the amorphous phase and that Ce doping reduced the oxygen deﬁciency within the a-In2O3 matrix, likely because of the higher bond strength of Ce–O than In–O. Moreover, the μ values decreased with increasing Ce content, indicating that Ce atoms act as scattering centers for free electrons in the amorphous structure. As shown in Figure 5(a), upon crystallization of the In2O3:H layer, N decreased with a large increase in μ. In addition, the slope of mobility as a function of temperature increased after crystallization. These results suggest a change in the carrier generation and scattering mechanisms. In previous works, we proposed that structural rearrangements during crystallization eliminate oxygen-vacancy-type defects with a large scattering cross section and produce Hi • and/or HO •, which act as singly charged donors.[41,47] In In2O3:W,H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, decreases of N were observed at the crystallization temperatures. However, the magnitude of the decreases of N decreased with increasing Me contents. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 6(a), the N values of the crystallized In2O3:H ﬁlms were 1 1020–1.5 1020 cm3 because of the Hi • and/or HO • donors. As the Me content was increased to 0.39 at.%, the N values increased with a similar slope of the dotted line. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a gradual increase of the N values. These results demonstrate that W and Ce were activated as donors by the crystallization process even in the presence of hydrogen. By contrast, the N of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm deposited at 200 C was 3 1019 cm3. The free carriers are assumed to be generated from intrinsic defects, mainly from oxygen-vacancytype defects, as revealed in previous works.[34,44] When the ﬁlms were doped with low Me contents, the N values increased in Figure 6.

A further increase in the Ce/In ratio increased the N values although the values were below the dotted line. These results indicate that Wand Ce work as electron donors. The overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors. Notably, the H contents determined by TDS and hydrogen forward-scattering spectrometry (HFS) reveal that large amounts of hydrogen are present that do not contribute to the carrier generation. The hydrogen passivates acceptors[56] to reduce the carrier compensation because the In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited signiﬁcantly high μ, as described below. We here focus on the μ values of the ﬁlms. Figure 6(b) summarizes the relationship between N and μ measured at room temperature for the as-deposited amorphous ﬁlms, solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms at 250 C, and polycrystalline ﬁlms deposited at 200 C. At a glance, the μ values varied depending on the ﬁlm structure and fabrication processes: the a-In2O3:H and In2O3: Me,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 40–60 cm2 V1 s1, the polyIn2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 30–90 cm2 V1 s1 that strongly depended on Me, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce, H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 110–160 cm2 V1 s1, and the spcIn2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values of 80 cm2 V1 s1. In general, the mobility of polycrystalline TCO ﬁlms is dominated by scattering produced by GBs, stacking faults, dislocations, point defects including ionized and neutral impurities, and phonons.[51,52] To distinguish between the contributions of the various scattering sources, a comparison of the Hall and optical mobilities and measurements of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect are useful. The ratio between the Hall mobility and the optical mobility reﬂects the effect of GB scattering: a ratio of 1 implies that GB scattering plays a negligible effect in the ﬁlms, whereas a ratio less than 1 implies that GB scattering inﬂuences the μ values, as explained in Section 1. When transport across GBs occurs mainly through thermionic emission instead of tunneling, the effect of GB scattering on the μ values increases with decreasing temperature.[51–53] This trend is also true for scattering induced by charged extended defects.[52] By contrast, scattering induced by ionized and neutral impurities is independent of temperature in a degenerately doped semiconductor, whereas phonon scattering becomes large with increasing temperature. From a previous analysis of spcIn2O3:H ﬁlms that exhibit transport properties similar to those shown in Figure 6, the Hall mobilities were equal to the optical mobilities,[47] suggesting that GB scattering plays a negligible effect and that intragrain properties limit the Hall mobilities in the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms. Figure 7 shows a plot of the data in Figure 5 for the spc-In2O3: H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms during the cooling process from 250 C to room temperature; the mobilities are plotted versus the corresponding carrier densities with temperature acting as parameter. The spc-In2O3:H and spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited i) a slight decrease in N with an increase in μ from 250 to 230 C and ii) a large increase in μ with a negligible change in N from 230 C to room temperature. The former result is explained by the desorption of H from the ﬁlms during heating under vacuum, whereas the latter result clearly suggests that phonon scattering dominates the ﬁlms’ μ values. The spcIn2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O and the spc-In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O exhibited high μ values of 160 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature. The high μ values with N values of 1 1020–2 1020 cm3 cannot be quantitatively explained by the current models,[49] as described in Section 1. However, the μ values strongly suggest that scattering produced by neutral and doubly charged ionized impurities is negligible and that their mobilities are limited by singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •) and by phonon scattering.[49] Indeed, the dominant valence states of Ce have been reported to be 3þ and 4þ in In2O3:Ce,H and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms.[6] Conversely, the μ values for the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm deposited at low PH2O increased slowly with decreasing temperature and the ﬁlm exhibited lower μ values at room temperature than the ﬁlm deposited at high PH2O. Plausibly, charged extended and point defects within grains are present in the ﬁlm because of low H contents and/or H effusion from the ﬁlm during post-annealing. Indeed, decreases in both the Hall and the optical mobility were observed in spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms when the ﬁlms were postannealed at higher temperatures (400 C).[47] By contrast, the μ values of the spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms with high Ce contents increased and N decreased during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. A further increase of the Ce content resulted in a large decrease of μ and a slight increase of N (Figure 6 and 7). These results imply that extensive Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) produced carrier scattering centers in addition to the singly charged donors (e.g., CeIn •, Hi •, HO •), leading to compensation of the free carriers, likely via the formation of defect complexes such as 2 CeIn •Oi00 in the ﬁlms. By contrast, spc-In2O3:W,H Figure 7. Variation of the carrier density (N) and mobility (μ) of spc-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films during cooling from 250 C to room temperature.

Because no large difference in the structure was detected between the spc-In2O3:W,H and spc-In2O3:H ﬁlms by XRD, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not shown here) analyses, the point defects within the grains that cannot be assessed by these characterization tools may be responsible for the low mobility. In addition, post-annealing of the poly-In2O3:W ﬁlm at 300 C increased the μ values to 110 cm2 V1 s1, much higher than the μ values of the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms, as will be shown later. The same post-annealing process was performed for the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms; however, the μ values of the ﬁlms did not increase (not shown here). Therefore, point defects associated with W and H or OH species may be responsible for the other scattering centers produced in the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms. With respect to the carrier scattering in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms, Figure 6(a) and (b) shows that the μ values of the polyIn2O3:Ce ﬁlms were much smaller than those of the corresponding spc-In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms. To investigate the dominant scattering centers in the polycrystalline ﬁlms, we postannealed the ﬁlms at 300 C. The [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values varied from [1.7 1020, 82] to [1.7 1020, 110], from [1.1 1020, 70] to [1.1 1020, 96], from [1.5 1020, 81] to [1.5 1020, 100], and from [1.9 1020, 88] to [2.0 1020, 110] after the post-annealing process for the poly-In2O3:W, poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 1 wt.%), poly-In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 2 wt.%), and poly-In2O3: Ce (CeO2: 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. In all of the ﬁlms, μ values increased with a negligible change in N. The mobility improvement was not accompanied by a change of the structural properties, as revealed by XRD (not shown). Thus, no recrystallization occurred during the post-annealing process. However, the point and extended defect densities were plausibly reduced by the process. That is, the as-deposited poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms contained a large amount of point and extended defects because of the low-temperature deposition and their mobilities were limited largely by intragrain properties. Notably, a linear increase of μ values with increasing N in Figure 6(b) for the asdeposited poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms seems like a suggestion at a glance that the GB scattering strongly inﬂuences the μ values if we assume similar grain sizes and trap densities at GBs in the polycrystalline ﬁlms. However, the aforementioned changes in transport properties induced by post-annealing clearly suggest that the μ values in the poly-In2O3:Me ﬁlms were limited by intragrain properties rather than by grain barriers. Finally, we discuss the role of solid-phase crystallization and H doping in the In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. The spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms exhibited μ values greater than those of the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms. In addition, the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1 wt.%) ﬁlms exhibited increases in μ with negligible changes in N during cooling from 250 C to room temperature. These results suggest that solid-phase crystallization substantially reduced scattering by GBs and extended and point defects within grains. These ﬁndings are attributed to fewer lattice defects because of the use of solid-phase crystallization instead of low-temperature crystal growth by physical vapor deposition. This ﬁnding is supported by the structural properties explained in Section 2.1. By contrast, H doping increased N. As observed in the middle panel of Figure 6 (a), the overall behavior of N as a function of the Me/In ratio for the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,He ﬁlms was the same as that for the poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms with an N offset of 1 1020 cm3. This result strongly suggests that the offset is produced by Hi • and/or HO • donors and by reduced carrier compensation through passivation of acceptors by hydrogen. Notably, the presence of hydrogen within the ﬁlms did not prevent activation of the Ce donors. However, further Ce doping (Ce/In 0.96%) resulted in saturation of N in conjunction with a decrease of μ. Conversely, W doping in In2O3:H apparently produced additional carrier scattering centers, as previously described. These results suggest that room may exist for further increasing N while maintaining a high μ by selecting appropriate metal dopants. 2.3. Optical Properties Figure 8 presents the optical constants for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Me ﬁlms, and (c) spcIn2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, as evaluated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As observed in the extinction coefﬁcient (k) spectra, all of the ﬁlms were transparent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. In the longer-wavelength region (>1200 nm), k increased with increasing N because of free-carrier absorption. In addition, the refractive index (n) of the ﬁlms shifted toward lower values in the NIR region with increasing N, consistent with the Drude model. In the ultraviolet region, all of the ﬁlms exhibited strong absorption. Figure 9 shows the absorption coefﬁcients (α ¼ 4πk/λ) for the (a) a-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms, (b) poly-In2O3 and In2O3: Me ﬁlms, and (c) spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Me,H ﬁlms. All of the ﬁlms exhibited absorption onsets at 2.7–2.8 eV. The α values steeply increased to greater than 105 cm1 at photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV, and the absorption varied depending on the dopant species in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms. The absorption edges increased with increasing N (Figure 6(a)) in the amorphous, polycrystalline, and solid-phase crystallized ﬁlms; this behavior is well explained by the Burstein–Moss shift. Next, we will consider the weaker absorption extending from the photon energies of 3.8–4.0 eV to the onset energies of 2.7– 2.8 eV. In In2O3, a strong optical absorption at ca. 3.7 eV in the ultraviolet was assigned to a direct transition, whereas an onset of weaker optical absorption at ca. 2.6 eV was assigned to an indirect transition from the valence-band maximum (VBM) away from the Γ-point to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) at the Γ-point.[63] However, recent ﬁrst-principles calculations and photoemission spectroscopy have revealed that there is no nature of indirect transition.[64–66] Speciﬁcally, optical transitions at ca. 2.9 eV from the VBM to the CBM at the Γ-point are forbidden by the symmetry of the bixbyite crystal, whereas optical transitions at ca. 3.7 eV from the lower-lying valence-band states (0.8 eV below the VBM) to the CBM are parityallowed.[64] Figure 9(d) shows a plots of the α values of the ﬁlms as a function of the photon energy on a logarithmic scale. The spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm showed an α value much less than 103 cm1 at 3 eV and exhibited an absorption onset of 2.7– 2.8 eV. This result is in good agreement with the α spectra of bulk In2O3 cystals,[63,67] suggesting high crystalline quality in the spc- status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

In addition, the onset energy reﬂects an indirect fundamental bandgap. The direct forbidden transitions weakly allowed away from the Γ-point may contribute to the absorption.[64–66] When compared with the spectra of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms, that of the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited milder slopes; in addition, the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm exhibited a higher α value than the spc-In2O3:H ﬁlm at 3 eV. Here, the slight shift of the α spectra along the horizontal axis is attributed to the difference in N values, as previously explained. The milder slope with higher α values reﬂects the existence of defect states in the poly-In2O3 ﬁlm. In addition, the structural disorder might weaken the selection rule of the direct forbidden transitions, giving rise to weak but non-negligible transitions. Furthermore, optical transitions that are forbidden by the selection rules could occur in the disordered structure of the a-In2O3:H ﬁlm, leading to α values much higher than those of the spc-In2O3:H and poly-In2O3 ﬁlms. Notably, the spc-In2O3:W,H and poly-In2O3:W ﬁlms exhibited higher α values at 3 eV than other crystallized and polycrystalline ﬁlms, respectively, even though the W-doped ﬁlms exhibited crystallinity comparable to the other ﬁlms, as revealed by the SEM, XRD, and TEM analyses. The greater absorption in the W-doped ﬁlms may originate from W dstates.[68] 3. Conclusion Two types of In2O3 ﬁlms with mobilities substantially greater than that of ITO were recently reported. Poly-In2O3 ﬁlms doped with metal (Ti, Zr, Mo, or W) impurities instead of Sn exhibited mobilities greater than 80 cm2 V1 s1 even when grown at low temperatures, and spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms fabricated at low temperatures exhibited mobilities greater 100 cm2 V1 s1. To determine the effect of the i) metal dopant species; ii) metal and H codoping; and iii) solid-phase crystallization process on the resultant transport properties, we fabricated poly-In2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce ﬁlms on glass substrates at 200 C and spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms post-annealed at 250 C via RPD. The obtained [N (cm3), μ (cm2 V1 s1)] values were [2.8 1019, 30], [1.5 1020, 90], [9.9 1019, 74], [1.4 1020, 85], and [1.8 1020, 94] for the poly-In2O3, In2O3:W (WO3: 1 wt.%), and In2O3:Ce (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively, whereas these values were [1.1 1020–1.5 1020, 140–160], [2.0 1020–2.4 1020, 82–84], [1.7 1020–2.1 1020, 140–160], [2.2 1020–2.4 1020, 130– 150], and [2.4 1020, 110–130] for the spc-In2O3:H, In2O3:W, H (WO3: 1 wt.%) and In2O3:Ce,H (CeO2: 1, 2, and 3 wt.%) ﬁlms, respectively. The N values of the crystallized ﬁlms were 1 1020 cm3 higher than those of the corresponding ﬁlms, indicating that H doping produces 1 1020 cm3 free electrons. In addition, Ce and W doping increased the carrier density with increasing Me/In ratio in both spc-In2O3:Me,H and poly-In2O3:Me deposited at 200 C, suggesting that Ce and W function as electron donors and that the presence of H in the ﬁlms does not affect their carrier activation. Analysis of the N–μ and μ–temperature behaviors of the spc-In2O3:Me,H and In2O3: Ce,H ﬁlms strongly supported the hypothesis that the free carriers were generated by singly charged donors (e.g., Hi •, HO •, CeIn •) and that scattering induced by the ionized impurities and phonons dominated their μ values. Conversely, the spc-In2O3:W,H ﬁlms exhibited a lower mobility of 80 cm2 V1 s1. The structural and electrical analyses and comparative studies between the spc-In2O3:W,H and polyIn2O3:W ﬁlms suggested the presence of point defects associated with W and H or OH species in the spc-In2O3:W, H ﬁlms. By contrast, poly-In2O3 and In2O3:Ce exhibited lower μ values than the spc-In2O3:H and In2O3:Ce,H ﬁlms, respectively. Changes in the N and μ values after the post-annealing process indicated that the mobility of the as-deposited polycrystalline ﬁlms was strongly limited by intragrain properties, i.e., scattering centers produced by stacking faults, dislocations, and point defects. Indeed, the SEM, TEM, and XRD analyses revealed that the ﬁlms had small grains with abundant lattice defects, in sharp contrast to the case of crystallized ﬁlms with large grains with high crystallinity. Furthermore, the ﬁlms exhibited larger absorption tails at 3 eV compared with those of the crystallized ﬁlms. These results strongly suggest that the solid-phase crystallization process serves to substantially improve the intragrain properties. Furthermore, EBSD analysis revealed that the PH2O and the Me contents during deposition determined the density of the crystalline nuclei within the asdeposited amorphous ﬁlms and, thus, also determined the grain size of the crystallized ﬁlms. 4. Experimental Section Approximately 60-nm-thick and 220-nm-thick In2O3 films were deposited onto glass substrates and SiO2/Si substrates via RPD (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, URT-IP2).[69] We used ceramic tablets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) with different impurities: pure In2O3, In2O3 with a WO3 content of 1 wt.%, and In2O3 with CeO2 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.%. The deposition gases were Ar, O2, and H2O at a total pressure of 0.4 Pa. The flow ratio of O2 to Ar was fixed at 24%, whereas the PH2O was varied from 1 105 to 5 104 Pa before deposition monitored by quadrupole mass spectrometry (Inficon, Transpector XPR3). For the fabrication of the polyIn2O3, In2O3:W, and In2O3:Ce films, the films were deposited at 200 C. Here, we used the notation without H because the heated substrate and growth surface suppressed the incorporation of a large amount of hydrogen into the film, as described in Section 2.1. However, the a-In2O3: H, In2O3:W,H, and In2O3:Ce,H films were fabricated without intentional substrate heating. The maximum substrate temperatures were observed to be less than 60 C during deposition using thermolabels attached to the glass and SiO2/Si substrates. After deposition, some films were postannealed at 250 C under vacuum to obtain crystallized films. Most of the characterizations of the films were conducted using 220-nmthick films on glass. Hereafter, we describe the layer structure when the characterization was conducted using specimens other than 220-nm-thick films on glass. The hydrogen contents in the films were evaluated by HFS (CEA) and TDS (ESCO, EMD-1000S) using 220-nm-thick films on SiO2/Si substrates. The contents of metal impurities within the films were analyzed using ICP-MS (Agilent, 8900 ICP-QQQ). The surface morphology and crystallinity of the films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi, S-4300) and XRD (Rigaku, SmartLab), respectively. EBSD (JEOL, JSM-7001F) was used to evaluate the crystalline orientation of each grain at an electron acceleration voltage of 15keV. The ρ, N, and μ values of the films were determined from Hall measurements (Toyo, ResiTest8300) in van der Pauw configurations at roomtemperature. Thetemperaturedependenceoftheelectrical properties was also evaluated every 10 C from 40 to 250 C, with subsequent cooling from250 Ctoroomtemperature.Duringheating,thefilmscrystallized.The opticalconstantsofthefilmsweredeterminedbySE(J.A.Woolam,M-2000) using60-nm-thickfilmsonSiO2/Sisubstrates.Here,theopticalconstantsat each wavelength were mathematically derived by inverting the measured SE status solidi physica a www.advancedsciencenews.com www.pss-a.com Phys.

The ICO:H ﬁlms deposited at 150 °C by dc arc-discharge ion plating were post-annealed at 200 °C. The relationship between the Hall mobility and carrier density of the polycrystalline ICO:H ﬁlms shows that the carrier transport is limited by an ionized impurity scattering mechanism inside the grains. The surfaces of the ICO:H ﬁlms were found to be very smooth and clear grain-boundary areas were not observed. © 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics A high carrier mobility of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) ﬁlms in solar cells is required to coexist with the high optical transparency and low ohmic losses due to light absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is caused by plasma oscillations, in proportion to the free-carrier density.1) Koida et al. showed that highly hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H) exhibited a Hall mobility exceeding 100 cm2 V¹1 s¹1.2) Various dopants of metal species such as W,3) Zr,4) and Mo5) have been used to dope polycrystalline In2O3 ﬁlms to improve the crystallinity, thereby reducing intragranular lattice defects. We have been investigating the properties of Ce-doped6) In2O3 ﬁlms. That study was based on two factors with their corresponding effects: (i) the effective ionic radius of Ce4+ with a coordination number of 6 (0.101 nm)7) is close to that of In3+ with the same coordination number (0.094 nm),7) leading to the reduction of microstrain in the vicinity of the dopant sites; (ii) the density of the oxygen vacancies can be reduced by doped CeO2 with a large standard formation enthalpy when compared to In2O3, resulting in crystallinity improvements. In this letter, we clarify the effects of both hydrogen doping with incorporated Ce and post-annealing on the structural and electrical properties of ICO:H ﬁlms. To this end, 100-nm-thick In2O3-based TCO ﬁlms were deposited by dc arc-discharge ion plating (IP).8) In2O3 with CeO2 (ICO) contents of 3 wt % and pure In2O3 (IO) pellets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) were used as resource materials. The ﬁlms were deposited on Corning Eagle XG glass substrates at 150 °C. The deposition gases were Ar, O2 (8–13 vol %), and H2 (0–2 vol %) and the total gas pressure during ﬁlm deposition was 0.45 Pa. The ultimate vacuum pressure of the process chamber before the deposition was ¯1 © 10¹4 Pa. The ﬁlm compositions were analyzed via rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering (HFS) using a CEA manufactured RBS system. The structural properties were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans using an MRS 6-axis diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert Pro) equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and parallel-beam optics. The electric conductivity and Hall voltage were measured with a Hall effect measurement system (Toyo Technica ResiTest 8300). The grain size of the ﬁlms was observed via ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi High-Tech SU8240), while the surface morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park Systems, NX20). Table I summarizes the In, Ce, O, and H compositions determined by RBS and HFS measurements for 100-nm-thick ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms deposited using H2-gas with ﬂow ratios of 0 and 1.0%, respectively, and identical oxygen partial pressures. The ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Note that little difference in Ce compositions was observed between the two ﬁlms, each being deposited by a different process. In addition, Table I shows that both ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms show oxygen-richness in contrast with the stoichiometric composition of In2O3. As mentioned below, the XRD data analysis does not show segregation of Ceoxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 in those ﬁlms. We conﬁrmed the effect of Ce doping on the control of O composition in the ﬁlms as described above; the density of the intragranular oxygen vacancies can be reduced. It is necessary to control the O composition in the ﬁlms, taking into account the fact that oxygen interstitials with electron afﬁnity would act as n-type killers within the grains and chemisorbed oxygen species at the grain boundaries with a negative charge (O¹) would form a barrier height to cause free-carrier scattering, resulting in the reduction of carrier mobility. Table I proves that co-doping of H with Ce donors with an increasing H2gas ﬂow ratio leads to an increase in H composition together with a slight decrease in the atomic ratio of O species. This indicates that the O composition of the ICO matrix can be systematically controlled by changing the H2-gas ﬂow ratio with Ce doping content during the deposition, combined with the post-annealing step. This technique, which is based on co-doping mixed with post-annealing, can work very well, because it can enhance the carrier transport due to intragranular microstructure improvements and it can reduce the contribution of grain-boundary scattering to the carrier transport. This will be discussed below. Figure 1 shows grazing incidence XRD patterns of the ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms with different H2-gas ﬂow ratios. All ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The incidence angle was ﬁxed at 1.0°. These data were plotted with a logarithmic intensity scale to overemphasize many weak peaks in the patterns. No peaks of Ce-oxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 were observed. We investigated the effects Table I. In, Ce, O, and H compositions (in at. %) of ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms subjected to post-annealing at 200 °C.

Note that no peaks for as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms were observed. We found the effect of the post-annealing on the structure of the ﬁlms. The amorphous phase of as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms changed to a bixbyte In2O3 polycrystalline structure: the angles of the diffracted peaks were almost identical to those of ITO containing 6.25% of Sn (dotted line).9) Firstly, lattice parameters (l) were estimated from the peaks that were identiﬁed for each ﬁlm. Then, the lattice parameter (L) was deﬁned as the average of all l-values. In addition, the residual strain (S) in each ﬁlm was calculated on the basis of the size-strain analysis of the peak data obtained by the strain model. The L and S values obtained for each ﬁlm are shown in Fig. 1. Herein, we found that H doping reduces both the L and S values of the ICO ﬁlms. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the Hall mobility (®H) and carrier density (N) for the post-annealed ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms with H2-gas ﬂow ratios ranging from 1.0 to 2.0%. For comparison, the data for post-annealed IO:H with H2-gas ﬂow ratios in the range of 1.0 to 2.0% were added. Note that the Hall motility of the ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% shows higher values, given by 130–145 cm2 V¹1 s¹1, when compared to those corresponding to IO:H ﬁlms. The carrier mobility that is limited by ionized impurity scattering, ®I, was calculated by the Brooks–Herring–Dingle (BHD) theory,10,11) including both degeneracy and nonparabolicity of the conduction bands.12) On the other hand, the carrier mobility that is limited by grain boundary scattering, ®G, was calculated based on the Seto theory.13) For increasing values of N of up to ³1 © 1020 cm¹3, ®I is larger than ®G. When N is further increased, ®G becomes larger than ®I. Note that the expression 1 H ¼ 1 G þ 1 I cannot explain the values of ®H for ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The experimental data and the expression above imply that ®G is very large compared to ®I. We thus concluded that ionized impurity scattering is a dominant factor that limits the carrier mobility in such ﬁlms. Figure 2 shows that the expression above explains the behavior of ®H for all other ICO:H ﬁlms, including ICO:H ﬁlms with H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0%, and ICO ﬁlms very well. It can be concluded that both ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering determine the carrier mobility of those ﬁlms. In addition, it should be mentioned that the two ICO:H ﬁlms for which H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0% were used exhibit a crystal-grown area and an amorphous area, as discussed below. In such ﬁlms with mixed structures, the scattering mechanism in the amorphous area also contributes to the carrier transport in the ﬁlms. On the other hand, for IO:H ﬁlms, additional study is required. Figure 3 shows the back scattered electron (BSE) images of the surface structures of ICO, ICO:H, and IO:H ﬁlms captured by FE-SEM. The grains of the post-annealed ICO ﬁlm were clearly observed for sizes of and below 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The grain boundaries of the as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlm with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were not clearly observed [Fig. 3(b)]. Note that Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show conspicuous grains with kaleidoscope patterns for the postannealed ICO:H ﬁlms. Figures 3(e) and 3(f ) show both the crystal-grown and amorphous areas for post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.5%, which is consistent with the results displayed by Fig. 1(c). The grains of the postannealed IO:H ﬁlm deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were observed to be over 1 µm in size [Fig. 3(g)], whereas the grains of the post-annealed IO:H ﬁlm with a H2gas ﬂow ratio of 2.0% were not clearly observed, similarly to those of the previously mentioned ICO:H ﬁlms deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. Figure 4 shows the AFM images of post-annealed ICO, next to those corresponding to as-deposited and postannealed ICO:H with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The one-dimensional cross-sectional scans of surface proﬁles are added to Fig. 4. We assumed that signals measured within the ﬁeld with a height of 2 nm or higher were particles generated when the glass substrates were scrubbed. The AFM results, which include the calculated average surface roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq), show that the surface of the post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlm was smoother than that of other ﬁlms. Spiky signals with heights ranging from 1 to 2 nm were observed on the ﬁlm surface. Note that the Ra value excluding these signals was just 0.232 nm [see Fig. 4(f )]. The spiky signals could not be identiﬁed from the analyzed data obtained by FE-SEM and AFM measurements, making it unclear whether they originate in the particles or due to projections from the ﬁlm.

The ICO:H ﬁlms deposited at 150 °C by dc arc-discharge ion plating were post-annealed at 200 °C. The relationship between the Hall mobility and carrier density of the polycrystalline ICO:H ﬁlms shows that the carrier transport is limited by an ionized impurity scattering mechanism inside the grains. The surfaces of the ICO:H ﬁlms were found to be very smooth and clear grain-boundary areas were not observed. © 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics A high carrier mobility of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) ﬁlms in solar cells is required to coexist with the high optical transparency and low ohmic losses due to light absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is caused by plasma oscillations, in proportion to the free-carrier density.1) Koida et al. showed that highly hydrogen-doped In2O3 (IO:H) exhibited a Hall mobility exceeding 100 cm2 V¹1 s¹1.2) Various dopants of metal species such as W,3) Zr,4) and Mo5) have been used to dope polycrystalline In2O3 ﬁlms to improve the crystallinity, thereby reducing intragranular lattice defects. We have been investigating the properties of Ce-doped6) In2O3 ﬁlms. That study was based on two factors with their corresponding effects: (i) the effective ionic radius of Ce4+ with a coordination number of 6 (0.101 nm)7) is close to that of In3+ with the same coordination number (0.094 nm),7) leading to the reduction of microstrain in the vicinity of the dopant sites; (ii) the density of the oxygen vacancies can be reduced by doped CeO2 with a large standard formation enthalpy when compared to In2O3, resulting in crystallinity improvements. In this letter, we clarify the effects of both hydrogen doping with incorporated Ce and post-annealing on the structural and electrical properties of ICO:H ﬁlms. To this end, 100-nm-thick In2O3-based TCO ﬁlms were deposited by dc arc-discharge ion plating (IP).8) In2O3 with CeO2 (ICO) contents of 3 wt % and pure In2O3 (IO) pellets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) were used as resource materials. The ﬁlms were deposited on Corning Eagle XG glass substrates at 150 °C. The deposition gases were Ar, O2 (8–13 vol %), and H2 (0–2 vol %) and the total gas pressure during ﬁlm deposition was 0.45 Pa. The ultimate vacuum pressure of the process chamber before the deposition was ¯1 © 10¹4 Pa. The ﬁlm compositions were analyzed via rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering (HFS) using a CEA manufactured RBS system. The structural properties were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans using an MRS 6-axis diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert Pro) equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and parallel-beam optics. The electric conductivity and Hall voltage were measured with a Hall effect measurement system (Toyo Technica ResiTest 8300). The grain size of the ﬁlms was observed via ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi High-Tech SU8240), while the surface morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park Systems, NX20). Table I summarizes the In, Ce, O, and H compositions determined by RBS and HFS measurements for 100-nm-thick ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms deposited using H2-gas with ﬂow ratios of 0 and 1.0%, respectively, and identical oxygen partial pressures. The ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Note that little difference in Ce compositions was observed between the two ﬁlms, each being deposited by a different process. In addition, Table I shows that both ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms show oxygen-richness in contrast with the stoichiometric composition of In2O3. As mentioned below, the XRD data analysis does not show segregation of Ceoxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 in those ﬁlms. We conﬁrmed the effect of Ce doping on the control of O composition in the ﬁlms as described above; the density of the intragranular oxygen vacancies can be reduced. It is necessary to control the O composition in the ﬁlms, taking into account the fact that oxygen interstitials with electron afﬁnity would act as n-type killers within the grains and chemisorbed oxygen species at the grain boundaries with a negative charge (O¹) would form a barrier height to cause free-carrier scattering, resulting in the reduction of carrier mobility. Table I proves that co-doping of H with Ce donors with an increasing H2gas ﬂow ratio leads to an increase in H composition together with a slight decrease in the atomic ratio of O species. This indicates that the O composition of the ICO matrix can be systematically controlled by changing the H2-gas ﬂow ratio with Ce doping content during the deposition, combined with the post-annealing step. This technique, which is based on co-doping mixed with post-annealing, can work very well, because it can enhance the carrier transport due to intragranular microstructure improvements and it can reduce the contribution of grain-boundary scattering to the carrier transport. This will be discussed below. Figure 1 shows grazing incidence XRD patterns of the ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms with different H2-gas ﬂow ratios. All ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The incidence angle was ﬁxed at 1.0°. These data were plotted with a logarithmic intensity scale to overemphasize many weak peaks in the patterns. No peaks of Ce-oxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 were observed. We investigated the effects Table I. In, Ce, O, and H compositions (in at. %) of ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms subjected to post-annealing at 200 °C.

Note that no peaks for as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms were observed. We found the effect of the post-annealing on the structure of the ﬁlms. The amorphous phase of as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms changed to a bixbyte In2O3 polycrystalline structure: the angles of the diffracted peaks were almost identical to those of ITO containing 6.25% of Sn (dotted line).9) Firstly, lattice parameters (l) were estimated from the peaks that were identiﬁed for each ﬁlm. Then, the lattice parameter (L) was deﬁned as the average of all l-values. In addition, the residual strain (S) in each ﬁlm was calculated on the basis of the size-strain analysis of the peak data obtained by the strain model. The L and S values obtained for each ﬁlm are shown in Fig. 1. Herein, we found that H doping reduces both the L and S values of the ICO ﬁlms. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the Hall mobility (®H) and carrier density (N) for the post-annealed ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms with H2-gas ﬂow ratios ranging from 1.0 to 2.0%. For comparison, the data for post-annealed IO:H with H2-gas ﬂow ratios in the range of 1.0 to 2.0% were added. Note that the Hall motility of the ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% shows higher values, given by 130–145 cm2 V¹1 s¹1, when compared to those corresponding to IO:H ﬁlms. The carrier mobility that is limited by ionized impurity scattering, ®I, was calculated by the Brooks–Herring–Dingle (BHD) theory,10,11) including both degeneracy and nonparabolicity of the conduction bands.12) On the other hand, the carrier mobility that is limited by grain boundary scattering, ®G, was calculated based on the Seto theory.13) For increasing values of N of up to ³1 © 1020 cm¹3, ®I is larger than ®G. When N is further increased, ®G becomes larger than ®I. Note that the expression 1 H ¼ 1 G þ 1 I cannot explain the values of ®H for ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The experimental data and the expression above imply that ®G is very large compared to ®I. We thus concluded that ionized impurity scattering is a dominant factor that limits the carrier mobility in such ﬁlms. Figure 2 shows that the expression above explains the behavior of ®H for all other ICO:H ﬁlms, including ICO:H ﬁlms with H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0%, and ICO ﬁlms very well. It can be concluded that both ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering determine the carrier mobility of those ﬁlms. In addition, it should be mentioned that the two ICO:H ﬁlms for which H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0% were used exhibit a crystal-grown area and an amorphous area, as discussed below. In such ﬁlms with mixed structures, the scattering mechanism in the amorphous area also contributes to the carrier transport in the ﬁlms. On the other hand, for IO:H ﬁlms, additional study is required. Figure 3 shows the back scattered electron (BSE) images of the surface structures of ICO, ICO:H, and IO:H ﬁlms captured by FE-SEM. The grains of the post-annealed ICO ﬁlm were clearly observed for sizes of and below 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The grain boundaries of the as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlm with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were not clearly observed [Fig. 3(b)]. Note that Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show conspicuous grains with kaleidoscope patterns for the postannealed ICO:H ﬁlms. Figures 3(e) and 3(f ) show both the crystal-grown and amorphous areas for post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.5%, which is consistent with the results displayed by Fig. 1(c). The grains of the postannealed IO:H ﬁlm deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were observed to be over 1 µm in size [Fig. 3(g)], whereas the grains of the post-annealed IO:H ﬁlm with a H2gas ﬂow ratio of 2.0% were not clearly observed, similarly to those of the previously mentioned ICO:H ﬁlms deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. Figure 4 shows the AFM images of post-annealed ICO, next to those corresponding to as-deposited and postannealed ICO:H with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The one-dimensional cross-sectional scans of surface proﬁles are added to Fig. 4. We assumed that signals measured within the ﬁeld with a height of 2 nm or higher were particles generated when the glass substrates were scrubbed. The AFM results, which include the calculated average surface roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq), show that the surface of the post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlm was smoother than that of other ﬁlms. Spiky signals with heights ranging from 1 to 2 nm were observed on the ﬁlm surface. Note that the Ra value excluding these signals was just 0.232 nm [see Fig. 4(f )]. The spiky signals could not be identiﬁed from the analyzed data obtained by FE-SEM and AFM measurements, making it unclear whether they originate in the particles or due to projections from the ﬁlm.

We have been investigating the properties of Ce-doped6) In2O3 ﬁlms. That study was based on two factors with their corresponding effects: (i) the effective ionic radius of Ce4+ with a coordination number of 6 (0.101 nm)7) is close to that of In3+ with the same coordination number (0.094 nm),7) leading to the reduction of microstrain in the vicinity of the dopant sites; (ii) the density of the oxygen vacancies can be reduced by doped CeO2 with a large standard formation enthalpy when compared to In2O3, resulting in crystallinity improvements. In this letter, we clarify the effects of both hydrogen doping with incorporated Ce and post-annealing on the structural and electrical properties of ICO:H ﬁlms. To this end, 100-nm-thick In2O3-based TCO ﬁlms were deposited by dc arc-discharge ion plating (IP).8) In2O3 with CeO2 (ICO) contents of 3 wt % and pure In2O3 (IO) pellets (Sumitomo Metal Mining) were used as resource materials. The ﬁlms were deposited on Corning Eagle XG glass substrates at 150 °C. The deposition gases were Ar, O2 (8–13 vol %), and H2 (0–2 vol %) and the total gas pressure during ﬁlm deposition was 0.45 Pa. The ultimate vacuum pressure of the process chamber before the deposition was ¯1 © 10¹4 Pa. The ﬁlm compositions were analyzed via rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering (HFS) using a CEA manufactured RBS system. The structural properties were analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans using an MRS 6-axis diffractometer (PANalytical X’Pert Pro) equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and parallel-beam optics. The electric conductivity and Hall voltage were measured with a Hall effect measurement system (Toyo Technica ResiTest 8300). The grain size of the ﬁlms was observed via ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi High-Tech SU8240), while the surface morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park Systems, NX20). Table I summarizes the In, Ce, O, and H compositions determined by RBS and HFS measurements for 100-nm-thick ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms deposited using H2-gas with ﬂow ratios of 0 and 1.0%, respectively, and identical oxygen partial pressures. The ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Note that little difference in Ce compositions was observed between the two ﬁlms, each being deposited by a different process. In addition, Table I shows that both ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms show oxygen-richness in contrast with the stoichiometric composition of In2O3. As mentioned below, the XRD data analysis does not show segregation of Ceoxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 in those ﬁlms. We conﬁrmed the effect of Ce doping on the control of O composition in the ﬁlms as described above; the density of the intragranular oxygen vacancies can be reduced. It is necessary to control the O composition in the ﬁlms, taking into account the fact that oxygen interstitials with electron afﬁnity would act as n-type killers within the grains and chemisorbed oxygen species at the grain boundaries with a negative charge (O¹) would form a barrier height to cause free-carrier scattering, resulting in the reduction of carrier mobility. Table I proves that co-doping of H with Ce donors with an increasing H2gas ﬂow ratio leads to an increase in H composition together with a slight decrease in the atomic ratio of O species. This indicates that the O composition of the ICO matrix can be systematically controlled by changing the H2-gas ﬂow ratio with Ce doping content during the deposition, combined with the post-annealing step. This technique, which is based on co-doping mixed with post-annealing, can work very well, because it can enhance the carrier transport due to intragranular microstructure improvements and it can reduce the contribution of grain-boundary scattering to the carrier transport. This will be discussed below. Figure 1 shows grazing incidence XRD patterns of the ICO and ICO:H ﬁlms with different H2-gas ﬂow ratios. All ﬁlms were post-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The incidence angle was ﬁxed at 1.0°. These data were plotted with a logarithmic intensity scale to overemphasize many weak peaks in the patterns.

Note that no peaks for as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms were observed. We found the effect of the post-annealing on the structure of the ﬁlms. The amorphous phase of as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlms changed to a bixbyte In2O3 polycrystalline structure: the angles of the diffracted peaks were almost identical to those of ITO containing 6.25% of Sn (dotted line).9) Firstly, lattice parameters (l) were estimated from the peaks that were identiﬁed for each ﬁlm.

In addition, the residual strain (S) in each ﬁlm was calculated on the basis of the size-strain analysis of the peak data obtained by the strain model. The L and S values obtained for each ﬁlm are shown in Fig. 1. Herein, we found that H doping reduces both the L and S values of the ICO ﬁlms.

When N is further increased, ®G becomes larger than ®I. Note that the expression 1 H ¼ 1 G þ 1 I cannot explain the values of ®H for ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The experimental data and the expression above imply that ®G is very large compared to ®I. We thus concluded that ionized impurity scattering is a dominant factor that limits the carrier mobility in such ﬁlms. Figure 2 shows that the expression above explains the behavior of ®H for all other ICO:H ﬁlms, including ICO:H ﬁlms with H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0%, and ICO ﬁlms very well. It can be concluded that both ionized impurity scattering and grain boundary scattering determine the carrier mobility of those ﬁlms. In addition, it should be mentioned that the two ICO:H ﬁlms for which H2-gas ﬂow ratios of 1.5 and 2.0% were used exhibit a crystal-grown area and an amorphous area, as discussed below. In such ﬁlms with mixed structures, the scattering mechanism in the amorphous area also contributes to the carrier transport in the ﬁlms. On the other hand, for IO:H ﬁlms, additional study is required. Figure 3 shows the back scattered electron (BSE) images of the surface structures of ICO, ICO:H, and IO:H ﬁlms captured by FE-SEM. The grains of the post-annealed ICO ﬁlm were clearly observed for sizes of and below 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The grain boundaries of the as-deposited ICO:H ﬁlm with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were not clearly observed [Fig. 3(b)]. Note that Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show conspicuous grains with kaleidoscope patterns for the postannealed ICO:H ﬁlms. Figures 3(e) and 3(f ) show both the crystal-grown and amorphous areas for post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlms with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.5%, which is consistent with the results displayed by Fig. 1(c). The grains of the postannealed IO:H ﬁlm deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0% were observed to be over 1 µm in size [Fig. 3(g)], whereas the grains of the post-annealed IO:H ﬁlm with a H2gas ﬂow ratio of 2.0% were not clearly observed, similarly to those of the previously mentioned ICO:H ﬁlms deposited with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. Figure 4 shows the AFM images of post-annealed ICO, next to those corresponding to as-deposited and postannealed ICO:H with a H2-gas ﬂow ratio of 1.0%. The one-dimensional cross-sectional scans of surface proﬁles are added to Fig. 4. We assumed that signals measured within the ﬁeld with a height of 2 nm or higher were particles generated when the glass substrates were scrubbed. The AFM results, which include the calculated average surface roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq), show that the surface of the post-annealed ICO:H ﬁlm was smoother than that of other ﬁlms. Spiky signals with heights ranging from 1 to 2 nm were observed on the ﬁlm surface. Note that the Ra value excluding these signals was just 0.232 nm [see Fig. 4(f )]. The spiky signals could not be identiﬁed from the analyzed data obtained by FE-SEM and AFM measurements, making it unclear whether they originate in the particles or due to projections from the ﬁlm.

Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers are characteristically described as thin ﬁlms that exhibit simultaneously high visible wavelength transparency and electrical conductivity. The majority of known TCO materials are n-type semiconductors where defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurity substitutions and interstitials donate electrons to the conduction band providing charge carriers for the ﬂow of electric current [1]. However, hole doping by ionised cation vacancies, impurity acceptor ion substitutions and/or oxygen interstitials which act as electron acceptors is also possible leading to ptype TCO materials [2]. Although p-type TCO materials have been reported, the commonly applied TCO materials are n-type semiconductors namely, F- or Sb-doped tin oxide, Sn- or Zn-doped indium oxide and Al-, B- or Ga-doped zinc oxide. These ﬁlms are used in low emissivity windows, gas sensors, ﬂat panel displays, thin ﬁlm transistors, light emitting diodes and solar cells, to name a few [1,3–7]. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in optimising the preparation of TCO thin ﬁlms for large area depositions required by industry such as increasing the deposition rate, low temperature processing on plastic substrates and improvement of uniformity, among others. However, the resistivity of these ﬁlms has saturated at about 10−4Ωcm though values in the range of 10−5Ωcm can be obtained under controlled laboratory conditions [7]. Other well known TCO materials are In- or Sn-doped CdO which are not widely used because of the hazardous nature of cadmium and a negative public perception against cadmium containing compounds. The resistivity ρ, of a semiconductor is related to the charge carrier density N and the carrier mobility µ by the relation 1 ρ = Nμe ð1Þ where e is the electronic charge given by 1.602×10−19C. If N is increased to reduce ρ, the TCO ﬁlm transmission especially in the near infrared (NIR) region reduces as a result of absorption by free carriers or by metal-like reﬂection. It is therefore, important that further reductions in the TCO resistivity must not adversely reduce the optical transparency of the ﬁlm. However ρ of a TCO ﬁlm may be decreased without reducing the NIR transmission by increasing µ rather than N. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of absorptance in a material with a ﬁxed carrier density (5×1020cm−3) as the mobility increases [8]. Since TCO ﬁlms useful for most applications must have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) which requires a degenerate carrier density ≥10 20cm−3 and ideallyρ<10−3Ωcm, using Eq. (1), the corresponding Hall mobility would be µ≥62.5 cm2V−1s−1. Therefore, in this contribution, high mobility transparent conducting oxides (HMTCO) are used to refer to TCO ﬁlms which fulﬁll the above conditions and have a value of mobility ≥62.5cm2V−1s−1. Ti- and Mo-doped In2O3 (in short, ITiO and IMO respectively) are examples of TCO materials possessing high mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with high NIR transparency while maintaining low ρ~10−4Ωcm. Fig. 2 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra of several thin ﬁlms composed of ITiO, IMO, In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO). The ITiO and IMO ﬁlms were prepared by magnetron sputtering in research laboratory conditions while the ITO and FTO ﬁlms were obtained from commercial vendors, for details refer to a previous study in [9]. The sheet resistance of the ﬁlms ranges from 6 Ω/□to 11 Ω/□and the indium based ﬁlms have a comparable resistivity ρ<2×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is slightly higher at 3.9×10−4Ωcm. While the transmission of the ITO ﬁlm begins to dip at around 950 nm, that of the IMO and ITiO ﬁlms remains high and begins to dip for wavelengths >1200 nm. Though the NIR optical loses may be further reduced by reducing N, doing so indiscriminately can decrease the conductivity and/or the optical band gap of the TCO layer and adversely affect the electrical properties and transparency in the visible wavelength region. Therefore, TCO materials with sufﬁciently high N (≥1020cm−3) while maintaining a high mobility and transparency are desirable. High mobility TCO materials have been prepared in the past but the resistivity has been greater than 10−3Ωcm because of a relatively lowN<10 19cm−3 [10,11]. Such low carrier density levels would require a Hall mobility in the excess of 400 cm2V−1s−1 to achieve ρ<10−4Ω cm. CdO is a well known material with mobility as high as µ = 146 cm2 V−1 s−1 with N=1.5×1020cm−3 [12] but is not suitable for most TCO applications because of absorptioninthe visible light spectrum as a result of a low band gap <3.0 eV and environmental issues. High mobility TCO ﬁlms with a sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and an optical transmission of ≥80% over the visible to NIR wavelengths are potentially useful to enhance solar cell efﬁciency. This is particularly useful in the case of multi-junction solar cells, consisting of stacks of different semiconductors with appropriately matched band gaps to increase the spectral response over a wide wavelength range. Ideally, the bottommost cell should receive photons that are unused by the upper absorbers and thus transmitted through the upper cells including their TCO contacts. Fig. 3 shows a graph comparing the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of single junction solar cells based on absorbers with different optical band gaps and using conventional TCO materials such as ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn as transparent contacts. The EQE curve of the gallium rich CuIn1 −XGaXSe2 (CIGS) cell, labelled C, in Fig. 3 is unexpectedly low for energies above the theoretical band gap because of poor current collection as a result of recombination [13]. Otherwise, for all the solar cells, a signiﬁcant portion of the loss in EQE is caused by optical losses in the front contact TCO. If such solar cell structures are used in a multi-junction device, the amount of light reaching the bottom absorber (with the lowest band gap) is severely reduced causing a current mismatch [14]. When comparing the EQE of the CIS absorber represented by curve A in Fig. 3 with the TCO transmission spectra presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that improvements in the EQE, especially for wavelengths greater than 900 nm are possible if HMTCO contacts are used. Thus, HMTCO ﬁlms could potentially improve the efﬁciency of such solar cells by reducing the optical losses while minimising resistive losses. In this article strategies used to improve the carrier mobility in degenerately doped TCO thin ﬁlms are reviewed. A survey of dopant elements known to improve the mobility of In2O3 and CdO is presented. A discussion aimed at understanding the reasons for high mobility in these materials is given. Examples of the application of HMTCO ﬁlms in solar cells are described and used to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of improved NIR transmission to these devices. Finally, challenges and prospects for further development of HMTCO materials are discussed. 2. Strategies to attain high mobility in TCO materials Various strategies have been employed to increase the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms while maintaining high transparency and conductivity as reviewed by Exarhos and Zhou [15]. Traditionally, the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms has been enhanced by improving the crystalline structure by means such as heat treatment, choice of deposition technique as well as choice of substrate. Here, we expand on some of those strategies and include several other methods that are perhaps less well known, but seem promising. 2.1. Post deposition heat treatment TCO thin ﬁlms prepared without intentional substrate heating or with low process temperatures exhibit low electron mobility as a result of scattering by grain boundaries and/or point defects. Post deposition heat treatment in different ambient conditions reduces point and/or dislocation defects in the amorphous or poorly crystallised TCO ﬁlms by increasing the grain size and improving the overall crystal structure enhancing the electron mobility [3,16]. However, effective heat treatment may require temperatures approaching 1840 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 600 °C, that are unsuitable for heat sensitive substrates such as polymers or even soda lime glass which may soften and introduce undesirable impurities in the TCO ﬁlms and thus other methods have to be used. 2.2. Choice of deposition method While ﬁlm growth by highly energetic particles may increase the grain size of TCO ﬁlms, an excessive transfer of momentum may damage the ﬁlms and reduce the mobility [16]. During sputtering, the discharge voltage at the target surface repels both negative oxygen ions and neutral argon atoms, which arrive at the substrate with high kinetic energy of ~100 eV and distort the TCO crystalline structure [17]. Since the discharge voltage is less for RF sputtering than for DC sputtering, it is usual for TCO ﬁlms grown by the former method to have higher values of mobility [17,18]. The kinetic energy of particles related to pulsed laser deposition varies from 1 eV to a few 100 eV but is easier to control than in sputtering resulting in better TCO crystalline structures leading to higher mobility [19]. 2.3. Control of crystal structure using mono-crystalline substrates Control of crystal growth by using highly oriented substrates is known to enhance the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms by improving crystallinity. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) is often used to grow low resistivity ITO thin ﬁlms [20]. Though the ITO crystal quality can be improved the increase in the mobility is not drastic compared to ITO prepared on glass. Therefore, other factors such as the character of the doping ions may play a role in determining the charge carrier mobility. However, the highest reported mobility for highly conductive ZnO: Al~70 cm2V−1s−1 at N>1020cm−3 has been reported for ﬁlms grown on c-plane sapphire [19]. A study of Cd2SnO4 ﬁlms grown on different substrate illustrates this point further where the mobility of the ﬁlms was measured as 609 cm2V−1s−1 (the highest reported value for a degenerate TCO material), 330 cm2V−1s−1 and 27 cm2V−1s−1 using MgO(111), MgO(100) and boro-silicate glass substrates, respectively [21]. The relatively high cost and limited suitability of these highly oriented substrates on large areas precludes the use of epitaxially grown TCO in a wide range of applications, especially displays and solar cells. 2.4. Controlling impurity concentration Hall mobility in TCO thin ﬁlms can be increased by reducing scattering caused by intrinsic crystalline defects and/or ionised impurities. A relatively high mobility in ZnO:Al up to 44.2 cm2V−1s−1 with N=3.8×1020cm−3 was achieved using a ZnO target with a low Al2O3 concentration of 0.5wt.% [22]. By minimising intrinsic defects in thin ﬁlm ZnO, a mobility of 440 cm2V−1s−1 but with a low N of<1016 cm−3 could be achieved [11]. 2.5. Selective doping methods Selective doping methods may increase the relaxation time in TCO materials by separating the doping and charge transport regions. In such cases, the charge carriers are provided by the heavily doped regions while the lightly doped regions provide a high mobility path where scattering by ionised or neutral impurities, is minimised. Zone conﬁning is achieved by applying a (quasi) periodic temperature gradient across the surface of the substrate during deposition of the TCO material [23]. Fig. 3.

The mobility values are 105 cm2V−1s−1, 77cm2V−1s−1, 27cm2V−1s−1 and 25cm2V−1s−1 for ITiO, IMO, ITO and FTO, respectively. The resistivity values of the indium based ﬁlms range from 1.3×10−4Ωcm to 1.9×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is 3.9×10−4Ωcm. Reproduced with permission from [9]. 1841 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 During ﬁlm growth, the impurities tend to accumulate in the colder areas of the substrate surface. The impurity movement and temperature gradient are mutually parallel and are perpendicular to the growth direction. The result is a ﬁlm consisting of alternate zones of heavily doped metal oxide and almost pure metal oxide (see Fig. 4a). Using this method, a high mobility of 103 cm2V−1s−1 and an average carrier density of 1.4×1021cm−3 give a resistivity of 4.4×10−5Ω cm for ITO [23,24]. However, the visible transparency of ITO prepared using this method including the substrate, was below 80% [24]. Selective doping using multi-layered ﬁlms composed of lightly and heavily doped semiconductors alternately stacked in the direction of the ﬁlm growth (see Fig. 4b), is also referred to as modulation doping [25]. Several studies predict that modulation doping may improve TCO mobility [26,27]. Simulations on multi-layered ﬁlms composed of InGaO3 (relatively large electron afﬁnity and low carrier density) alternately stacked with ZnO:Al layers (low electron afﬁnity and high carrier density) have predicted that high conductivity >4.2×104S cm−1 for carrier densities ~1020cm−3 are possible [26]. Simulations of the transport mechanisms revealed that the conductivity is very sensitive to the quantum well thickness. The authors proposed that high mobilities derived from doping modulation would require individual layers of <5 nm thick and high crystal quality materials with close lattice matching in order to avoid interface defects which would be challenging to achieve in practice [26]. A mobility of 1560 cm V−1s−1 is possible if N=1×1020cm−3 at the bottom of a 5 nm wide quantum well giving a resistivity of 4.0×10−5Ω cm. A similar simulation was performed for modulation-doped multi-layers composed of ZnO|ZnMgO|ZnMgO:Al| ZnMgO all of which are closely lattice matched [26]. Mobilities as high as 145 cm2V−1s−1 were predicted for a structure with an average carrier density of 3.8×1018cm−3 but the lowest resistivity was limited to 1.5×10−3Ω cm. Multi-layers consisting of ZnO|ZnO:Al and ZnO|Zn1−X MgXO:Al have also been prepared on a- and c-plane sapphire substrates and though the crystal structure was comparable to that of single layers, the resistivity was quite high [28]. The authors attributed this effect to the high oxidation sensitivity of the thin ﬁlms which passivated the donors and reduced the carrier density. Also, multi-layered ﬁlms consisting of the dopant oxide ﬁlms alternating with the host cation oxide have been prepared, i.e. InOX (2.0 nm)|SnOY (0.2 nm) obtaining a relatively low mobility of 17 cm2V−1s−1 and a carrier density of 5×1020cm−3 [29]. To date, the predicted high mobility cannot be obtained in thin ﬁlms prepared by modulation doping as desired for most TCO applications such as photovoltaic cells. 2.6. Hydrogen inclusion Total energy calculations based on ﬁrst principles suggest that the bond length between hydrogen and the nearest host oxygen atom in a metal oxide is virtually the same regardless of the metal [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen is “pinned” at a ﬁxed energy level which introduces shallow defect states inside the conduction band of oxides with a high electron afﬁnity leading to n-type doping. It has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates structural defects in TCO materials in the same way as is well known for thin ﬁlm silicon [31,32]. Hydrogen inclusion in TCO materials is achieved either during ﬁlm deposition or by post deposition annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. One of the highest mobilities for ITO (μ~145 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been achieved by post deposition treatment in a hydrogen plasma [32] while that for ZnO:Al (μ~50 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been reported for ﬁlms sputtered with a small amount of hydrogen added to the sputter gas [33]. A high value of µ=130 cm2V−1s−1 for N=1.8×1020cm−3 has also been reported for hydrogen doped In2O3 [32]. 2.7. Choice of appropriate dopants The highest mobilities achieved for conventional degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering are typically 40–50 cm2V−1s−1 for ITO [16,34,35] and ZnO:Al [7,17]. However, speciﬁc elements have been used to prepare degenerate CdO and In2O3 thin ﬁlms by sputtering with µ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with transmission of >80% in the visible and near infra-red wavelength regions. While undoped CdO thin ﬁlms have a high mobility, the optical band gap is too low for use as a transparent conductor for visible light. However, doping cadmium oxide with several elements e.g. In [12], Sc [36], Y [37] and Ti [38] can lead to mobilities above 62.5 cm2V−1s−1 while maintaining N≥1020cm−3. A wider range of doping elements has been used to achieve high mobility in In2O3 thin ﬁlms such as Mo [39–41], Ti [42–47], W [48–51], Zr [42,43,52–55], and Gd [56]. Details of dopants elements leading to high mobility in CdO and In2O3 are presented later in Section 4.3. 3. Deposition methods for degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms with mobility higher than 62 cm2V−1s−1 Impurity doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms with high mobility can be prepared using a variety of methods as listed in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that though high mobility in impurity doped In2O3 can be achieved by a wide range of deposition techniques, the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and/or post deposition annealing further enhances the Hall mobility. The lowest resistivity reported for IMO thin ﬁlms to date is 6.7×10−5Ω cm with a high mobility (250cm2V−1s−1) grown at 500 °C byPLD onquartz[41]. However, the NIR opticaltransmissionis not known as a high transmittance (~90%) was only presented for visible light. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of high mobility in impurity doped CdO and In2O3 The mobility µ of an electron in semiconductors depends on the relaxation time τ, the electronic charge e and the effective carrier mass m* in the conduction band as given by the following relationship μ = eτ m* : ð2Þ Therefore, the mobility can be increased by increasing τ or by decreasing m*. Increasing τ requires ﬁlms with fewer defects which may be achieved by lower carrier density, less grain boundaries and less neutral impurities. Decreasing m*, requires semiconductors with a widely dispersed conduction band. The scattering mechanisms that govern the electron transport in semiconductors are described in detail in text books such as that by Lundstrom [64]. Of these, the scattering mechanisms relevant to ntype TCO thin ﬁlms have been identiﬁed by other authors [3,65–67]. Brieﬂy, they are: i. Grain boundary scattering caused by the discontinuity presented by grain boundaries especially in polycrystalline thin ﬁlm Fig. 4. Schematic showing charge carrier distributions in relation to the direction of ﬁlm growth of semiconductors prepared using selective doping by zone conﬁning (a) and modulation (b). The dark and light sections denote regions of high and low carrier density, respectively. 1842 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 materials. A space charge region formed around the grain boundaries and the resulting potential barrier scatters the electrons crossing this region reducing the mobility. Grain boundary scattering only signiﬁcantly affects the overall TCO mobility if the grain size is about the same as the mean free path of the charge carriers. ii. Ionised impurity scattering caused by deﬂection of free carriers by the long-range electrostatic ﬁelds associated with intentional dopants and defects such as interstitials and vacancies. iii. Optical phonon scattering caused by lattice vibrations of bonds in a polar semiconductor which induce an electric ﬁeld that interacts with a charge moving through the lattice. iv. Acoustic-phonon scattering caused by an acoustic wave propagation through a crystal lattice which causes the atoms to oscillate about their equilibrium positions and interfere with the electron motion. v. Neutral impurity scattering caused by non-ionised impurities. vi. Piezoelectric scattering which arises from electric ﬁelds caused by the strain associated with lattice vibrations in crystals where partially ionic bonds occur such that the unit cell does not contain a centre of symmetry. Matthiesen's rule states that the contribution of different scattering processes to the mobility and thus carrier transport is additive provided that the scattering mechanisms are independent [64]. Therefore for the above scattering processes, the overall mobility is given by the following relation. 1 μ = ∑ n i=1 1 μi ð3Þ where µi is the mobility due to the ith scattering mechanism. In practice, the conductivity of TCO materials cannot be increased by simultaneously increasing the carrier density and the mobility. Usually, the mobility is observed to saturate and even start to reduce as the carrier density is increased indicating dominant scattering by ionised impurities. Normally, grain boundary scattering is dominant for N≤1019cm−3 while charge impurity scattering is more signiﬁcant for N≥1019cm−3 for ITO and ZnO:Al [1,28,34,66,68]. Recent studies also suggest that for N>1019cm−3, the nature of the scattering differs for both ITO and ZnO:Al as a result of the piezoelectricity of the latter material leading to higher trap densities [66]. 4.1. Role of crystalline quality and structure Poor crystalline quality may cause a reduction in the relaxation time and thus mobility as a result of increased point defects, grain boundaries and lattice distortion. Electron transport in n-type semiconductor is facilitated by the vacant s-orbitals of neighbouring cations in the crystal lattice overlapping to form a conduction path. Moreover, if the crystal structure is disrupted by say, a cation vacancy, the spatial spread of the vacant s-orbital around that site is disrupted causing the effective mass of the electron to increase thus reducing its mobility. Therefore, shorter cation–cation bond length and a favourable distribution of the cations are believed to increase the mobility of the electrons in the semiconductor. Early work by Shannon [69] on single crystals in the CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family revealed that oxide structures with continuous edge sharing of cation octahedra are essential for conductivity in metal oxides. Later work by Ingram et al. [70] on thin ﬁlms of the same CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family extended this rule to include structures where octahedra share corners. They also classiﬁed TCO materials according to the coordination of the cations e.g. ZnO has tetrahedral coordination, while CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and other Cd containing spinel oxides have octahedral coordination. The decrease in both conductivity and mobility was also correlated to a decrease in the octahedral cation density in the structure in the order: CdO (rock salt)>In2O3 (bixbyite)>SnO2 (rutile) [70]. Studies of ZnSnO4 by Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that the unusually low mobility is a result of disorder on the cation octahedral sites which may disrupt transport between edge sharing cations [71]. Therefore, since high mobility with degenerate doping has only been reported for CdO and In2O3 based compounds with octahedrally coordinated cations, the associated cubic structure may also favour high mobility. 4.2. Role of the electronic band structure The electronic band structure of TCO materials can be studied by theoretical modelling or by measurements of the relaxation time and effective mass as well as the Hall parameters. Owing to the simple structure of CdO, the majority of theoretical electronic band structure studies have been done on this material. Freeman et al. [72,73] have identiﬁed three salient features of the electronic band structure of the conduction band of a TCO material which affect the charge carrier transport mechanisms namely, the curvature, the dispersion and the position. A parabolic conduction band minimum ensures a low effective carrier mass of the electrons which promotes high mobility. A study of the Cd1+XIn2−2XSnXO4 system shows that both the density of states effective mass and the relaxation time increase with N resulting in a cancellation effect such that the mobility is less than expected [74].

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 contrast, the effective carrier mass of IMO was determined as 0.32me and found to be independent of N implying a parabolic conduction band minimum[58].A widely dispersed conduction band minimum allows the drift of electrons unimpeded through the crystal structure resulting in a higher relaxation time and thus higher mobility. Electronic band structure calculations of InXCd1−XO thin ﬁlms for which mobility up to 91.5 cm2V−1s−1 withN>1020cm−3 was measured, revealed an electron effective mass of 0.24–0.26me and a broadening of the conduction band edge by hybridization of the Cd 5s and In 5s bands [12]. The calculated effective electron mass agrees with a value of 0.25me determined by Seebeck measurements [75]. Theoretical studies also suggest that the lowest conduction band of In2O3 is split with Sn doping due to the strong hybridization with dopant s-type states and this splitting contributes to both the decrease of the plasma frequency and the mobility of the carriers [73]. In contrast, calculations of the IMO electronic band structure suggest that high mobility is achievable in degenerate In2O3:Mo as the d-states of Mo do not hybridize with the s-states of In resulting in m* similar to undoped In2O3 [76]. 4.3. Chemical character of impurity dopant element From the descriptions given above, it can be seen that the choice of elements that induce high mobility in TCO materials has largely been empirical. Few if any studies have been conducted to ﬁnd the underlying mechanisms for high mobility caused by speciﬁc dopants. A series of studies predicted that the mobility of doped In2O3 would increase with the Lewis acid strength of the doping element and reported this effect for Ge4+, Si4+ and Sn4+ [77] as well as for Cu, Ti and Zr [78]. However, the µ of the TCO ﬁlms studied generally ranged from 45 cm2V−1s−1 to 55 cm2V−1s−1 and in some cases, the ﬁlms were non-degenerate. In this contribution, we shall attempt to apply the same principles to known degenerately doped In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms with mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1. The Lewis acid strength L can be calculated using a formula developed by Zhang [79] as follows L = Z r2 −7:7χz + 0:8 ð4Þ where r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force due to the oxidation state Z of the ion and χz is the electronegativity of the element in the respective oxidation state. Using this formula, the Lewis acid strengths of elements that are now known to induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms were compiled in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All these ﬁlms presented are highly transparent in the visible and most (where reported) have a high near infra-red region transmission. Generally, it can be seen that the dopants which induce higher mobilities are transition elements which have a higher Lewis acid strength than the host cation. The lists in Tables 2 and 3 are not exhaustive and have been compiled, where possible, from TCO ﬁlms prepared by MOCVD or sputtering, respectively, on glass substrates to reduce the inﬂuence of the ﬁlm deposition technique on the mobility values reported. Also, these ﬁlms may not represent the highest possible mobility achieved by a given dopant. However, most of the dopants listed that induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO are strong Lewis acids compared to Cd2+ and In3+, respectively. There are two exceptions in Table 2, namely H+ and Gd3+. The Lewis acid strength for H+ has not been calculated because of the difﬁculty in determining the ionic radius which is anyway expected to be much less than that of In3+. As mentioned previously, H+ is a shallow donor in most TCO ﬁlms with a high electron afﬁnity, hydrogen may also passivate defect states in In2O3 thus increasing theτ and improving µ [32]. However, the optical properties of H-doped In2O3 have not yet been reported. On the other hand, Gd3+ has a much higher ionic radius and a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ but corresponds to a high mobility of 128 cm2V−1s−1. Gadolinium belongs to a special group of metals known as Lanthanoids, most of which have a partially ﬁled 4f orbital, lying below group three transition metals in the periodic table and hence may warrant further investigation [80]. While doping CdO by Sn4+ and In3+ leads to µ~70 cm2V−1s−1, doping using Y3+ and Ti4+ both transition metal ions results in a drastic increase inµ. We note here that the highest mobility for CdO based material has been observed for a Cd1−XSnXO layer grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgO single crystals, as 609 cm2V−1s−1 and N=4.74×1020cm−3. Sn4+ beinga non-transition metal ion with a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ will induce a lower mobility in In2O3 than the transition elements listed in Table 2. On the other hand, mobility values of <62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with N>1020cm−3 have been reported for nontransition metal dopants with high enough Lewis acid strengths such as Sb5+ (3.559), Ge4+(3.059) and Si4+ (8.098) [77]. According to Wen et al. [77], the high Lewis acid dopants polarise the electronic charge away from the O2−2p valence band more strongly than weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering centre hence increasing the mobility. Similarly, the reason for higher mobility in IMO compared to intrinsic In2O3 has been explained by Mo suppressing scattering by oxygen interstitials [58]. However, if the Lewis acid is too strong e.g. Ge in In2O3, the dopant has a greater afﬁnity to oxygen and may incorporate an excess of oxygen in the lattice which would then limit the µ by the introduction of scattering centres [77]. Originally, the high mobility of IMO was attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+ ions that would contribute three extra electrons to the In2O3 matrix [57]. Later studies by another group suggested that Mo in IMO exists as both Mo4+ and Mo6+ for high carrier density and only as Mo6+ for ﬁlms with lower carrier density [85].

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 transition elements with a lower oxidation state such as Ti and Zr, etc showhighmobility, ahighoxidationstate isnotnecessarily aconditionfor high mobility. The charge carrier mobility and the visible light transparency of Ti-, Zr-, and Ge-doped In2O3 are much higher than that of ITO for the same dopant atomic concentration [78]. A similar comparison of In2O3 doped by Sn, Ti and Zr, all of which, can have a oxidation state +4 showed that the electron mobility and the NIR transmission were highest for the transition metal dopants [55]. Though the role of possible multiple valency e.g. of Ti as Ti2+ was not considered, these studies asserted that high mobility in In2O3 at least is only exhibited for transition metal dopants. 5. Application of high mobility TCO thin ﬁlms in solar cells At the front of a solar cell, the TCO layer acts as an electrical contact as well as a window to allow light through to the PV absorber layer. At the back of the cell, the TCO usually acts as an interfacial layer to improve the contact resistance between the PV absorber and a metallic reﬂector and also as an optical coupling layer by improving the refractive index matching. In bifacial solar cells, the back contact must act both as an electrical contact and as a window layer to let light through the back of the PV absorber layer. Since high photoconversion efﬁciency in solar cells requires minimal optical and electrical losses, a TCO layer with sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and transparency of >80% over the wavelength spectrum useable by the solar cell is mandatory. High mobility TCO materials are especially desirable where a high transparency of >80% is required over a wide spectral range (400–1300 nm) such as in micro-crystalline silicon, CIGS and other multi-junction solar cells. 5.1. Single junction solar cells High mobility TCO layers can be used as front contact for single junction solar cells in the superstrate conﬁguration because the highest possible process temperatures can be used to optimise the resistivity and transparency. A record efﬁciency of 16.5% for CdTe solar cells has been achieved using CdSnO4 coated glass in the superstrate conﬁguration [86]. Also, an improved light trapping structure for nano-crystalline silicon solar cells using In2O3:Mo layers with a textured ZnO layer can increase the QE for wavelengths exceeding 900 nm compared to cells using ZnO:Al [87]. On the other hand, using In2O3:Ti, a relatively low efﬁciency of 10.7% (compared to state of the art efﬁciency ~20%) has been obtained for CIGS solar cells in the substrate conﬁguration (glass|Mo|CIGS|ZnO|ITiO) [88]. The reason for this low efﬁciency is the high series resistance of the cell caused by high resistivity of the ITiO, since the processing of ITiO could not be done at high temperatures, a problem encountered for all other high mobility TCO ﬁlms as discussed later. 5.2. Bifacial solar cells Bifacial CIGS thin ﬁlm solar cells have been prepared on ITiO coated substrates with improved efﬁciency under rear side illumination as a result of reduced NIR light absorption [89]. However, again here, since the back contact must be highly conductive, a means of processing the HMTCO at low temperature with reasonable conductivity must be developed to realise the full potential of bifacial cells. 5.3. Multi-junction solar cells The top and intermediate solar cells in a multi-junction conﬁguration require a transparent conducting contact at both the front and back of the cell to ensure efﬁcient transmission of unused light to the underlying lower band gap solar cell. CdTe with an optical band gap ~1.45 eV and amorphous silicon ~1.7 eV are examples of solid state absorber materials suitable for upper junctions in multi-junction solar cells. Also, dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) whose spectral response can be adjusted by varying the TiO2 nano-particle size or the sensitising dye, are promising candidates for the top junction in a multi-junction solar cells. CdTe solar cells with a signiﬁcantly high efﬁciency of 13.9% have been developed on Cd2SnO4 coated glass (µ~53.2 cm2V−1s−1, resistivity ρ~1.8×10−4Ω cm) while maintaining a NIR transparency of 50% for the entire device [90]. While a high efﬁciency of the top solar cell is desirable, its full impact on the entire multi-junction solar cell efﬁciency cannot be realised unless the NIR transparency is improved to ensure adequate current matching with the bottom cells [14]. Improvements in NIR transparency through a TCO|CdTe|TCO device structure to values above 60%, require the use of a HMTCO e.g. Mo- or Ti-doped In2O3, at both the front and back sides of the solar cell to reduce parasitic absorption and reﬂection losses [9]. Fig. 5 shows the NIR transmission spectra of identical CdTe solar cells using all IMO or all ITO contacts. There is a signiﬁcant gain in NIR transmission when using IMO contacts for a CdTe solar cell that would act as either a top or an intermediate absorber in a multi-junction solar cell. Such a stack requires that the rear side TCO, which has to be prepared at low temperatures over the absorber layers, is sufﬁciently conductive to prevent losses in the total cell voltage and ﬁll factor which would limit the overall photo-conversion cell efﬁciency. However, high mobility TCOs have been used to improve the total current of a tandem solar cell consisting of an Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell [91]. On the other hand, the TCO layers applied at both the front and rear of a dye sensitised solar cell, can be prepared using high process temperatures without the danger of destroying the mesoscopic TiO2 layers. Taking advantage of this fact, semi-transparent dye sensitised solar cells were prepared using ITiO coated glass for possible application in tandem solar cells [92]. While the NIR transparency increased to 60% compared to DSC devices using FTO coated glass, the efﬁciency was somewhat lower i.e. 5.8% compared to 8.2%, respectively [92]. The reason for the lower efﬁciency was the different growth conditions of the TiO2 interfacial layer on the smoother ITiO ﬁlms (compared to FTO) and on the elevated resistivity of the ITiO after a sintering step at 450 °C in air required to prepare the porous TiO2 absorber. A slight improvement in the DSC efﬁciency to 6.8% could be achieved by adjusting the growth conditions of the dense TiO2 interfacial layer and by heating the entire stack in vacuum after the sintering step in air [93]. The improvement occurred primarily because of increased ﬁll factor resulting from a lower series resistance due to lower resistivity ITiO layers. Heating the ITiO layer in vacuum, desorbs loosely bound oxygen at the surface creating Fig. 5.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 vacancies and oxygen residing along grain boundaries (if the TCO is slightly porous) thus lowering the depletion barrier along the grain boundaries, increasing the charge carrier density while improving the electron mobility, respectively. This “conduction recovery” phenomenon is used for gas sensor application and was reported in 1977 for CdIn2O4 [69] and in the early 1980s for SnO2 [94] and In2O3 [95]. 6. Challenges and prospects In 1999, Coutts et al. [96] outlined key areas of basic research to improve the opto-electronic properties of TCO thin ﬁlms focusing on the development of improved materials which can be easily applied on an industrial scale. While the HMTCO materials reviewed in this article can be prepared with µ of >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 using sputtering and MOCVD which are well developed deposition techniques for industrial fabrication, some challenges still remain. 6.1. Low mobility in TCO ﬁlms prepared with low processing temperature It is desirable to prepare thin ﬁlms at low temperatures to coat plastic substrates or pre-deposited layers of an opto-electronic device with minimal damage, to reduce the energy input into the manufacturing process and to avoid diffusion of undesirable impurities from the substrate into the TCO ﬁlms. We note here that all the low resistivity TCO materials with μ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 in Tables 2 and 3 were prepared with deposition temperatures of at least 300 °C. The typical evolution of the ρ, N and µ values of IMO thin ﬁlms with increasing heater temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The substrate temperature in this case is not more than 10% lower than the heater temperature. These ﬁlms were prepared by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering from a ceramic In2O3:Mo (98:2 wt%) target using argon containing 0.53 vol.% of oxygen at a sputter pressure of 1.0 Pa, with further details reported elsewhere [97]. The resistivity generally reduces as the heater temperature TH increases from 25 °C to 450 °C then saturates at about 2.0×10−4Ω cm at 450 °C and 500 °C. The decrease in resistivity is caused by a concurrent increase in N and µ from 0.6×1020cm−3 to 4.5×1020cm−3 and from 9 cm2V−1s−1 to 73 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Theobservedsuppressionofmobilitytovaluesbelow62.5 cm V−1s−1 at low process temperature of >300 °C, has also been observed by other groups for In2O3:Mo [39,43,45,47,85], In2O3:Ti [45], In2O3:Zr and In2O3: Wo [49]. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for IMO ﬁlms preparedwithoutintentional substrateheatingandwith heatingto500 °C which are described in depth elsewhere [97]. In both cases, the molybdenum exists in the oxidation states of +6 and +4 as well as an intermediate oxidation state +4<x<+6 [98,99]. The ﬁlms grown on heated substrates also contain a small amount of elemental Mo. Though the Mo6+ state is prevalent in both ﬁlms, the Mox+ species are much higher in the low temperature ﬁlm. These Mox+ species are associated withhydroxyls andothercomplex oxides,suchas Mo4O11[99] which may exist as neutral impurities in the ﬁlm and thus reduce the mobility by scattering as has also been reported for In2O3:Sn ﬁlms [34,100]. Additionally, the carrier density of the ﬁlms increases as expected from theory as the Mo6+ species exceeds the sum of the remaining Mo species in the ﬁlm. While this result agrees with some authors [57], other [85] report that the Mo4+ species rather than the Mo6+ contribute to the conduction electrons in IMO. However, both the maximum values of carrier density ~2×1020cm−3 and mobility 44 cm V−1s−1 reported in [85] are less than the corresponding values of 4×1020cm−3 and 73 cm V−1s−1 presented in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, in both cases, the dopant efﬁciency was lower than 100% indicating that some of the charge carriers could be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Table 4 lists the electrical and optical characteristics of IMO, IWO, and ITiO thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating. It can be seen that regardless of the deposition technique, the IMO ﬁlms have μ<25 cm2V−1s−1 which is slightly less than the value reported for degenerate ﬁlms of ITO [101,102] and ZnO:Al [17,103] and much less than that for intrinsic In2O3 [82,104], all deposited without intentional substrate heating. A similar problem is experienced for ﬁlms prepared using the other transition elements as dopants for In2O3 as listed in Table 4. The cause for low µ for ﬁlms prepared at low deposition temperatures is not yet fully understood. This is a major Fig. 6. Resistivity ρ (triangles), Hall mobility µ (circles) and charge carrier density N (squares) of IMO thin ﬁlms as a function of heater temperature. The lines are to guide the eye. Fig. 7. Mo 3d spectra for In2O3:Mo ﬁlms prepared without intentional heating (25°) and with a heater temperature of 500 °C. 1846 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 challenge that precludes the preparation of these high mobility ﬁlms onto heat sensitive substrates. An interesting development is a signiﬁcantly high mobility between 50cm2V−1s−1 and 60cm2V−1s−1 that can be obtained in degenerate amorphous Zn-doped In2O3 ﬁlms prepared without substrate heating [111,112]. These ﬁlms have a relatively high optical transmission in the NIR wavelength region and thus may be an alternative to high mobility TCO materials for coating heat sensitive substrates. It has been proposed that since oxygen vacancies contribute signiﬁcantly to the conductivity of the IZO thin ﬁlms, Zn2+ substitution on In3+ sites does not decrease the carrier density of In2O3 ﬁlms and thus a degenerate carrier density is maintained [104,111]. Further, Zn may increase the density of oxygen vacancies by reducing some of the In–O bonds [104] or by passivating defects caused by interstitial oxygen. The results of the studies mentioned above indicate that the electronic band structure rather than crystalline structure determines the maximum attainable high mobility in TCO materials. 6.2. Inadequate characterisation and analysis methods One of the major problems in studying the limitations of mobility in TCO ﬁlms is the difﬁculty in obtaining sufﬁciently accurate values of effective mass and relaxation times which are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms. Data extracted from optical analysis using Drude's model and the Burstein–Moss shift has to be treated with caution because of the difﬁculties in measuring the ﬁlm thickness to a high enough accuracy and assumptions that the conduction band is parabolic, respectively [8,113]. Young et al. [114] described a four coefﬁcient method used to measure the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients of TCO thin ﬁlms which can be used to determine the charge carrier density, mobility, the effective electron mass, the scattering mechanisms and relaxation time. However, though Hall measurements are widely used, experimental determination of the Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients for these high mobility TCO materials is rarely done, and hence the exact scattering mechanisms limiting the mobility can only be estimated or speculated. Studies on the electronic transport mechanisms reported for HMTCO ﬁlms so far seem to be empirical. Theoretical modelling using either computational chemistry or physics methods is a useful tool for calculating and understanding the structure and properties of materials and may even predict hitherto unknown materials with desirable transparent conducting properties. In particular, more insights into the inﬂuence of dopant chemistry, dopant concentration, and ﬁlm structure on the charge carrier transport mechanisms would aid improvements in the resistivity exhibited by these high mobility TCO materials. Developments in electronic band structure calculations may aid in predicting the material behaviour and can help to elucidate limitations to mobility and doping efﬁciency. For example, a combination of electronic band structure calculations and Seebeck measurements has been used to determine an electron effective mass of Cd2SnO4 around 0.25me [12,75] which is much higher than values of 0.08–0.11me and 0.04me, determined from the Burstein–Moss shift in the 1970s by Nozik [10] and Haacke [115], respectively. However, most of the reported theoretical electronic band structure calculations for HMTCO have focused onCdO ratherthanIn2O3,possiblybecauseofthesimplicityof theformer's rock salt structure. However since In2O3 is less hazardous material and thus more technologically important, more theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure and properties of this material are required to advance the development of TCO materials with improved conductivity. 6.3. Lack of alternative low cost and environmentally benign materials The high mobility with low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm values described in the previous sections have only been observed inmaterials based on In2O3 whichisrathercostlyandCdOwhichispotentiallyhazardousandmaynot be acceptable for environmental reasons. Efforts to dope cheaper and environmentally benign materials with transition elements have not yet resulted in higher mobility e.g. ZnO doped with Zr [116], Ti [117], Mo [33], Ta doped SnO2 [118] and Nb-doped TiO2 [119]. Also, doping ZnO with hydrogen [120] gives a mobility of ~40 cm2V−1s−1 which is comparable withvaluesforAldopingandmuchlessthanthevalueof130 cm2V−1s−1 forH-doped In2O3[32]. Itispossiblethat the wurzite structure of ZnO with tetrahedral coordination is less favourable for electron transport than the cubic structure of CdO and In2O3 both of which have an octahedral coordination [70]. In general, for the same dopant element e.g. tin, the mobility of the ﬁlms increases going from ZnO to In2O3 to CdO as Sn inclusion in ZnO causes disorder in the octahedral causing short relaxation times despite the low effective electron mass [71]. Evidently, to achieve high mobility but cheap and non-hazardous TCO materials, alternative dopants or ternary compounds of ZnO, SnO2 and possibly TiO2, need to be developed and alternative materials that may not necessarily be oxides should be investigated. Single walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNT) are an emerging p-type transparent conducting material that has low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm with transparency of >80% over the visible and near infrared wavelength regions [121]. Promising solar cell efﬁciencies have been achieved on CIGS [122] and on CdTe [123] using SWNT as transparent contacts. Improvements in SWNT for application in PV should be aimed at reducing the relatively high visible light absorption in ﬁlms thicker than 100 nm [121–123]. 6.4. High resistivity despite higher mobility Lastly, despite the elevated values of mobility reported, the resistivity of the In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms has remained similar to that of state of the art ITO thin ﬁlms. A lower than expected dopant activation as well as an upper limit for carrier density above which the mobility begins to reduce has been reported for In2O3:Mo [58,85,124,125], In2O3:W [48,63], In2O3:Zr [52,54] and In2O3:Ti Table 4 A survey of transition element doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating.

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 [44,45]. For the case of In2O3:Mo, it is possible that the reduced dopant activation efﬁciency of Mo is caused by interstitial oxygen forming neutral complexes with some of the Mo at speciﬁc substitutional sites as inferred by some authors [124] and as demonstrated by the XPS measurements discussed in Section 6.1 of this article. Examination of heavily W-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms by Energy-Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed segregation of tungsten at the grain boundaries where it is ineffective as a donor [63]. This implies that the transition element dopants limit the mobility through formation of neutral and impurity scattering centres in much the same way as observed for In2O3:Sn [34,126]. Theoretical modelling and electronic bandstructure calculationsmay beused tounderstand thelimitations to the conductivity of HMTCO ﬁlms and to predict other eligible dopants. However, for accurate and realistic results, the required calculation time as well as the hardware resources increases with the complexity of the host oxides (especially In2O3) and the (transition metal) dopant ions making accurate theoretical calculations difﬁcult. 7. Summary The literature reviewed in this contribution shows that previously stated limits for mobility in low resistivity TCO ﬁlms have been exceeded. Several high mobility TCO materials based on In2O3 and CdO that combine low resistivity with a high visible and near infra-red optical transmission exist, and the highest mobilities attainable continue to be exceeded. Additionally, these materials can be prepared using industrially mature deposition technologies such as sputtering and chemical vapour deposition without signiﬁcant degradation of the opto-electronic properties. Several explanations have been given for the high mobility in speciﬁc In2O3 and CdO based materials but none wholly explain this phenomenon. The application of high mobility TCO layers in various types of thin ﬁlm solar cells has demonstrated their potential to improve the efﬁciency of single junction, multi-junction and bifacial solar cells. However, additional aspects such as thermal stability, formation of suitable interfaces with solar cell absorbers and low temperature growth of low resistivity HMTCO ﬁlms, need to be considered. For large scale production and regardless of the end use, high mobility TCO using alternative cheaper and less hazardous host cation elements than indium and cadmium respectively, are being sought. Other conventional TCO materials based on zinc and tin which are less costly and environmentally benign are still to achieve comparable resistivity and transparency. Additionally, despite the enhanced mobility of HMTCO materials, the resistivity values remain comparable to those of ITO and AZO and the expected reduction to values below 10−4Ω cm is still challenging. Therefore, in the short to medium term, new analysis techniques may be required to learn more about underlying mechanisms for the high mobility in In2O3 and CdO based TCO ﬁlms. In the long term, non-oxide materials may need to be developed while predictions using theoretical methods like electronic band structure calculations may aid in the identiﬁcation of hitherto unknown high mobility transparent conductors.

Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers are characteristically described as thin ﬁlms that exhibit simultaneously high visible wavelength transparency and electrical conductivity. The majority of known TCO materials are n-type semiconductors where defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurity substitutions and interstitials donate electrons to the conduction band providing charge carriers for the ﬂow of electric current [1]. However, hole doping by ionised cation vacancies, impurity acceptor ion substitutions and/or oxygen interstitials which act as electron acceptors is also possible leading to ptype TCO materials [2]. Although p-type TCO materials have been reported, the commonly applied TCO materials are n-type semiconductors namely, F- or Sb-doped tin oxide, Sn- or Zn-doped indium oxide and Al-, B- or Ga-doped zinc oxide. These ﬁlms are used in low emissivity windows, gas sensors, ﬂat panel displays, thin ﬁlm transistors, light emitting diodes and solar cells, to name a few [1,3–7]. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in optimising the preparation of TCO thin ﬁlms for large area depositions required by industry such as increasing the deposition rate, low temperature processing on plastic substrates and improvement of uniformity, among others. However, the resistivity of these ﬁlms has saturated at about 10−4Ωcm though values in the range of 10−5Ωcm can be obtained under controlled laboratory conditions [7]. Other well known TCO materials are In- or Sn-doped CdO which are not widely used because of the hazardous nature of cadmium and a negative public perception against cadmium containing compounds. The resistivity ρ, of a semiconductor is related to the charge carrier density N and the carrier mobility µ by the relation 1 ρ = Nμe ð1Þ where e is the electronic charge given by 1.602×10−19C. If N is increased to reduce ρ, the TCO ﬁlm transmission especially in the near infrared (NIR) region reduces as a result of absorption by free carriers or by metal-like reﬂection. It is therefore, important that further reductions in the TCO resistivity must not adversely reduce the optical transparency of the ﬁlm. However ρ of a TCO ﬁlm may be decreased without reducing the NIR transmission by increasing µ rather than N. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of absorptance in a material with a ﬁxed carrier density (5×1020cm−3) as the mobility increases [8]. Since TCO ﬁlms useful for most applications must have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) which requires a degenerate carrier density ≥10 20cm−3 and ideallyρ<10−3Ωcm, using Eq. (1), the corresponding Hall mobility would be µ≥62.5 cm2V−1s−1. Therefore, in this contribution, high mobility transparent conducting oxides (HMTCO) are used to refer to TCO ﬁlms which fulﬁll the above conditions and have a value of mobility ≥62.5cm2V−1s−1. Ti- and Mo-doped In2O3 (in short, ITiO and IMO respectively) are examples of TCO materials possessing high mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with high NIR transparency while maintaining low ρ~10−4Ωcm. Fig. 2 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra of several thin ﬁlms composed of ITiO, IMO, In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO). The ITiO and IMO ﬁlms were prepared by magnetron sputtering in research laboratory conditions while the ITO and FTO ﬁlms were obtained from commercial vendors, for details refer to a previous study in [9]. The sheet resistance of the ﬁlms ranges from 6 Ω/□to 11 Ω/□and the indium based ﬁlms have a comparable resistivity ρ<2×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is slightly higher at 3.9×10−4Ωcm. While the transmission of the ITO ﬁlm begins to dip at around 950 nm, that of the IMO and ITiO ﬁlms remains high and begins to dip for wavelengths >1200 nm. Though the NIR optical loses may be further reduced by reducing N, doing so indiscriminately can decrease the conductivity and/or the optical band gap of the TCO layer and adversely affect the electrical properties and transparency in the visible wavelength region. Therefore, TCO materials with sufﬁciently high N (≥1020cm−3) while maintaining a high mobility and transparency are desirable. High mobility TCO materials have been prepared in the past but the resistivity has been greater than 10−3Ωcm because of a relatively lowN<10 19cm−3 [10,11]. Such low carrier density levels would require a Hall mobility in the excess of 400 cm2V−1s−1 to achieve ρ<10−4Ω cm. CdO is a well known material with mobility as high as µ = 146 cm2 V−1 s−1 with N=1.5×1020cm−3 [12] but is not suitable for most TCO applications because of absorptioninthe visible light spectrum as a result of a low band gap <3.0 eV and environmental issues. High mobility TCO ﬁlms with a sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and an optical transmission of ≥80% over the visible to NIR wavelengths are potentially useful to enhance solar cell efﬁciency. This is particularly useful in the case of multi-junction solar cells, consisting of stacks of different semiconductors with appropriately matched band gaps to increase the spectral response over a wide wavelength range. Ideally, the bottommost cell should receive photons that are unused by the upper absorbers and thus transmitted through the upper cells including their TCO contacts. Fig. 3 shows a graph comparing the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of single junction solar cells based on absorbers with different optical band gaps and using conventional TCO materials such as ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn as transparent contacts. The EQE curve of the gallium rich CuIn1 −XGaXSe2 (CIGS) cell, labelled C, in Fig. 3 is unexpectedly low for energies above the theoretical band gap because of poor current collection as a result of recombination [13]. Otherwise, for all the solar cells, a signiﬁcant portion of the loss in EQE is caused by optical losses in the front contact TCO. If such solar cell structures are used in a multi-junction device, the amount of light reaching the bottom absorber (with the lowest band gap) is severely reduced causing a current mismatch [14]. When comparing the EQE of the CIS absorber represented by curve A in Fig. 3 with the TCO transmission spectra presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that improvements in the EQE, especially for wavelengths greater than 900 nm are possible if HMTCO contacts are used. Thus, HMTCO ﬁlms could potentially improve the efﬁciency of such solar cells by reducing the optical losses while minimising resistive losses. In this article strategies used to improve the carrier mobility in degenerately doped TCO thin ﬁlms are reviewed. A survey of dopant elements known to improve the mobility of In2O3 and CdO is presented. A discussion aimed at understanding the reasons for high mobility in these materials is given. Examples of the application of HMTCO ﬁlms in solar cells are described and used to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of improved NIR transmission to these devices. Finally, challenges and prospects for further development of HMTCO materials are discussed. 2. Strategies to attain high mobility in TCO materials Various strategies have been employed to increase the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms while maintaining high transparency and conductivity as reviewed by Exarhos and Zhou [15]. Traditionally, the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms has been enhanced by improving the crystalline structure by means such as heat treatment, choice of deposition technique as well as choice of substrate. Here, we expand on some of those strategies and include several other methods that are perhaps less well known, but seem promising. 2.1. Post deposition heat treatment TCO thin ﬁlms prepared without intentional substrate heating or with low process temperatures exhibit low electron mobility as a result of scattering by grain boundaries and/or point defects. Post deposition heat treatment in different ambient conditions reduces point and/or dislocation defects in the amorphous or poorly crystallised TCO ﬁlms by increasing the grain size and improving the overall crystal structure enhancing the electron mobility [3,16]. However, effective heat treatment may require temperatures approaching 1840 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 600 °C, that are unsuitable for heat sensitive substrates such as polymers or even soda lime glass which may soften and introduce undesirable impurities in the TCO ﬁlms and thus other methods have to be used. 2.2. Choice of deposition method While ﬁlm growth by highly energetic particles may increase the grain size of TCO ﬁlms, an excessive transfer of momentum may damage the ﬁlms and reduce the mobility [16]. During sputtering, the discharge voltage at the target surface repels both negative oxygen ions and neutral argon atoms, which arrive at the substrate with high kinetic energy of ~100 eV and distort the TCO crystalline structure [17]. Since the discharge voltage is less for RF sputtering than for DC sputtering, it is usual for TCO ﬁlms grown by the former method to have higher values of mobility [17,18]. The kinetic energy of particles related to pulsed laser deposition varies from 1 eV to a few 100 eV but is easier to control than in sputtering resulting in better TCO crystalline structures leading to higher mobility [19]. 2.3. Control of crystal structure using mono-crystalline substrates Control of crystal growth by using highly oriented substrates is known to enhance the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms by improving crystallinity. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) is often used to grow low resistivity ITO thin ﬁlms [20]. Though the ITO crystal quality can be improved the increase in the mobility is not drastic compared to ITO prepared on glass. Therefore, other factors such as the character of the doping ions may play a role in determining the charge carrier mobility. However, the highest reported mobility for highly conductive ZnO: Al~70 cm2V−1s−1 at N>1020cm−3 has been reported for ﬁlms grown on c-plane sapphire [19]. A study of Cd2SnO4 ﬁlms grown on different substrate illustrates this point further where the mobility of the ﬁlms was measured as 609 cm2V−1s−1 (the highest reported value for a degenerate TCO material), 330 cm2V−1s−1 and 27 cm2V−1s−1 using MgO(111), MgO(100) and boro-silicate glass substrates, respectively [21]. The relatively high cost and limited suitability of these highly oriented substrates on large areas precludes the use of epitaxially grown TCO in a wide range of applications, especially displays and solar cells. 2.4. Controlling impurity concentration Hall mobility in TCO thin ﬁlms can be increased by reducing scattering caused by intrinsic crystalline defects and/or ionised impurities. A relatively high mobility in ZnO:Al up to 44.2 cm2V−1s−1 with N=3.8×1020cm−3 was achieved using a ZnO target with a low Al2O3 concentration of 0.5wt.% [22]. By minimising intrinsic defects in thin ﬁlm ZnO, a mobility of 440 cm2V−1s−1 but with a low N of<1016 cm−3 could be achieved [11]. 2.5. Selective doping methods Selective doping methods may increase the relaxation time in TCO materials by separating the doping and charge transport regions. In such cases, the charge carriers are provided by the heavily doped regions while the lightly doped regions provide a high mobility path where scattering by ionised or neutral impurities, is minimised. Zone conﬁning is achieved by applying a (quasi) periodic temperature gradient across the surface of the substrate during deposition of the TCO material [23]. Fig. 3.

The mobility values are 105 cm2V−1s−1, 77cm2V−1s−1, 27cm2V−1s−1 and 25cm2V−1s−1 for ITiO, IMO, ITO and FTO, respectively. The resistivity values of the indium based ﬁlms range from 1.3×10−4Ωcm to 1.9×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is 3.9×10−4Ωcm. Reproduced with permission from [9]. 1841 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 During ﬁlm growth, the impurities tend to accumulate in the colder areas of the substrate surface. The impurity movement and temperature gradient are mutually parallel and are perpendicular to the growth direction. The result is a ﬁlm consisting of alternate zones of heavily doped metal oxide and almost pure metal oxide (see Fig. 4a). Using this method, a high mobility of 103 cm2V−1s−1 and an average carrier density of 1.4×1021cm−3 give a resistivity of 4.4×10−5Ω cm for ITO [23,24]. However, the visible transparency of ITO prepared using this method including the substrate, was below 80% [24]. Selective doping using multi-layered ﬁlms composed of lightly and heavily doped semiconductors alternately stacked in the direction of the ﬁlm growth (see Fig. 4b), is also referred to as modulation doping [25]. Several studies predict that modulation doping may improve TCO mobility [26,27]. Simulations on multi-layered ﬁlms composed of InGaO3 (relatively large electron afﬁnity and low carrier density) alternately stacked with ZnO:Al layers (low electron afﬁnity and high carrier density) have predicted that high conductivity >4.2×104S cm−1 for carrier densities ~1020cm−3 are possible [26]. Simulations of the transport mechanisms revealed that the conductivity is very sensitive to the quantum well thickness. The authors proposed that high mobilities derived from doping modulation would require individual layers of <5 nm thick and high crystal quality materials with close lattice matching in order to avoid interface defects which would be challenging to achieve in practice [26]. A mobility of 1560 cm V−1s−1 is possible if N=1×1020cm−3 at the bottom of a 5 nm wide quantum well giving a resistivity of 4.0×10−5Ω cm. A similar simulation was performed for modulation-doped multi-layers composed of ZnO|ZnMgO|ZnMgO:Al| ZnMgO all of which are closely lattice matched [26]. Mobilities as high as 145 cm2V−1s−1 were predicted for a structure with an average carrier density of 3.8×1018cm−3 but the lowest resistivity was limited to 1.5×10−3Ω cm. Multi-layers consisting of ZnO|ZnO:Al and ZnO|Zn1−X MgXO:Al have also been prepared on a- and c-plane sapphire substrates and though the crystal structure was comparable to that of single layers, the resistivity was quite high [28]. The authors attributed this effect to the high oxidation sensitivity of the thin ﬁlms which passivated the donors and reduced the carrier density. Also, multi-layered ﬁlms consisting of the dopant oxide ﬁlms alternating with the host cation oxide have been prepared, i.e. InOX (2.0 nm)|SnOY (0.2 nm) obtaining a relatively low mobility of 17 cm2V−1s−1 and a carrier density of 5×1020cm−3 [29]. To date, the predicted high mobility cannot be obtained in thin ﬁlms prepared by modulation doping as desired for most TCO applications such as photovoltaic cells. 2.6. Hydrogen inclusion Total energy calculations based on ﬁrst principles suggest that the bond length between hydrogen and the nearest host oxygen atom in a metal oxide is virtually the same regardless of the metal [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen is “pinned” at a ﬁxed energy level which introduces shallow defect states inside the conduction band of oxides with a high electron afﬁnity leading to n-type doping. It has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates structural defects in TCO materials in the same way as is well known for thin ﬁlm silicon [31,32]. Hydrogen inclusion in TCO materials is achieved either during ﬁlm deposition or by post deposition annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. One of the highest mobilities for ITO (μ~145 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been achieved by post deposition treatment in a hydrogen plasma [32] while that for ZnO:Al (μ~50 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been reported for ﬁlms sputtered with a small amount of hydrogen added to the sputter gas [33]. A high value of µ=130 cm2V−1s−1 for N=1.8×1020cm−3 has also been reported for hydrogen doped In2O3 [32]. 2.7. Choice of appropriate dopants The highest mobilities achieved for conventional degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering are typically 40–50 cm2V−1s−1 for ITO [16,34,35] and ZnO:Al [7,17]. However, speciﬁc elements have been used to prepare degenerate CdO and In2O3 thin ﬁlms by sputtering with µ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with transmission of >80% in the visible and near infra-red wavelength regions. While undoped CdO thin ﬁlms have a high mobility, the optical band gap is too low for use as a transparent conductor for visible light. However, doping cadmium oxide with several elements e.g. In [12], Sc [36], Y [37] and Ti [38] can lead to mobilities above 62.5 cm2V−1s−1 while maintaining N≥1020cm−3. A wider range of doping elements has been used to achieve high mobility in In2O3 thin ﬁlms such as Mo [39–41], Ti [42–47], W [48–51], Zr [42,43,52–55], and Gd [56]. Details of dopants elements leading to high mobility in CdO and In2O3 are presented later in Section 4.3. 3. Deposition methods for degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms with mobility higher than 62 cm2V−1s−1 Impurity doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms with high mobility can be prepared using a variety of methods as listed in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that though high mobility in impurity doped In2O3 can be achieved by a wide range of deposition techniques, the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and/or post deposition annealing further enhances the Hall mobility. The lowest resistivity reported for IMO thin ﬁlms to date is 6.7×10−5Ω cm with a high mobility (250cm2V−1s−1) grown at 500 °C byPLD onquartz[41]. However, the NIR opticaltransmissionis not known as a high transmittance (~90%) was only presented for visible light. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of high mobility in impurity doped CdO and In2O3 The mobility µ of an electron in semiconductors depends on the relaxation time τ, the electronic charge e and the effective carrier mass m* in the conduction band as given by the following relationship μ = eτ m* : ð2Þ Therefore, the mobility can be increased by increasing τ or by decreasing m*. Increasing τ requires ﬁlms with fewer defects which may be achieved by lower carrier density, less grain boundaries and less neutral impurities. Decreasing m*, requires semiconductors with a widely dispersed conduction band. The scattering mechanisms that govern the electron transport in semiconductors are described in detail in text books such as that by Lundstrom [64]. Of these, the scattering mechanisms relevant to ntype TCO thin ﬁlms have been identiﬁed by other authors [3,65–67]. Brieﬂy, they are: i. Grain boundary scattering caused by the discontinuity presented by grain boundaries especially in polycrystalline thin ﬁlm Fig. 4. Schematic showing charge carrier distributions in relation to the direction of ﬁlm growth of semiconductors prepared using selective doping by zone conﬁning (a) and modulation (b). The dark and light sections denote regions of high and low carrier density, respectively. 1842 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 materials. A space charge region formed around the grain boundaries and the resulting potential barrier scatters the electrons crossing this region reducing the mobility. Grain boundary scattering only signiﬁcantly affects the overall TCO mobility if the grain size is about the same as the mean free path of the charge carriers. ii. Ionised impurity scattering caused by deﬂection of free carriers by the long-range electrostatic ﬁelds associated with intentional dopants and defects such as interstitials and vacancies. iii. Optical phonon scattering caused by lattice vibrations of bonds in a polar semiconductor which induce an electric ﬁeld that interacts with a charge moving through the lattice. iv. Acoustic-phonon scattering caused by an acoustic wave propagation through a crystal lattice which causes the atoms to oscillate about their equilibrium positions and interfere with the electron motion. v. Neutral impurity scattering caused by non-ionised impurities. vi. Piezoelectric scattering which arises from electric ﬁelds caused by the strain associated with lattice vibrations in crystals where partially ionic bonds occur such that the unit cell does not contain a centre of symmetry. Matthiesen's rule states that the contribution of different scattering processes to the mobility and thus carrier transport is additive provided that the scattering mechanisms are independent [64]. Therefore for the above scattering processes, the overall mobility is given by the following relation. 1 μ = ∑ n i=1 1 μi ð3Þ where µi is the mobility due to the ith scattering mechanism. In practice, the conductivity of TCO materials cannot be increased by simultaneously increasing the carrier density and the mobility. Usually, the mobility is observed to saturate and even start to reduce as the carrier density is increased indicating dominant scattering by ionised impurities. Normally, grain boundary scattering is dominant for N≤1019cm−3 while charge impurity scattering is more signiﬁcant for N≥1019cm−3 for ITO and ZnO:Al [1,28,34,66,68]. Recent studies also suggest that for N>1019cm−3, the nature of the scattering differs for both ITO and ZnO:Al as a result of the piezoelectricity of the latter material leading to higher trap densities [66]. 4.1. Role of crystalline quality and structure Poor crystalline quality may cause a reduction in the relaxation time and thus mobility as a result of increased point defects, grain boundaries and lattice distortion. Electron transport in n-type semiconductor is facilitated by the vacant s-orbitals of neighbouring cations in the crystal lattice overlapping to form a conduction path. Moreover, if the crystal structure is disrupted by say, a cation vacancy, the spatial spread of the vacant s-orbital around that site is disrupted causing the effective mass of the electron to increase thus reducing its mobility. Therefore, shorter cation–cation bond length and a favourable distribution of the cations are believed to increase the mobility of the electrons in the semiconductor. Early work by Shannon [69] on single crystals in the CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family revealed that oxide structures with continuous edge sharing of cation octahedra are essential for conductivity in metal oxides. Later work by Ingram et al. [70] on thin ﬁlms of the same CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family extended this rule to include structures where octahedra share corners. They also classiﬁed TCO materials according to the coordination of the cations e.g. ZnO has tetrahedral coordination, while CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and other Cd containing spinel oxides have octahedral coordination. The decrease in both conductivity and mobility was also correlated to a decrease in the octahedral cation density in the structure in the order: CdO (rock salt)>In2O3 (bixbyite)>SnO2 (rutile) [70]. Studies of ZnSnO4 by Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that the unusually low mobility is a result of disorder on the cation octahedral sites which may disrupt transport between edge sharing cations [71]. Therefore, since high mobility with degenerate doping has only been reported for CdO and In2O3 based compounds with octahedrally coordinated cations, the associated cubic structure may also favour high mobility. 4.2. Role of the electronic band structure The electronic band structure of TCO materials can be studied by theoretical modelling or by measurements of the relaxation time and effective mass as well as the Hall parameters. Owing to the simple structure of CdO, the majority of theoretical electronic band structure studies have been done on this material. Freeman et al. [72,73] have identiﬁed three salient features of the electronic band structure of the conduction band of a TCO material which affect the charge carrier transport mechanisms namely, the curvature, the dispersion and the position. A parabolic conduction band minimum ensures a low effective carrier mass of the electrons which promotes high mobility. A study of the Cd1+XIn2−2XSnXO4 system shows that both the density of states effective mass and the relaxation time increase with N resulting in a cancellation effect such that the mobility is less than expected [74].

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 contrast, the effective carrier mass of IMO was determined as 0.32me and found to be independent of N implying a parabolic conduction band minimum[58].A widely dispersed conduction band minimum allows the drift of electrons unimpeded through the crystal structure resulting in a higher relaxation time and thus higher mobility. Electronic band structure calculations of InXCd1−XO thin ﬁlms for which mobility up to 91.5 cm2V−1s−1 withN>1020cm−3 was measured, revealed an electron effective mass of 0.24–0.26me and a broadening of the conduction band edge by hybridization of the Cd 5s and In 5s bands [12]. The calculated effective electron mass agrees with a value of 0.25me determined by Seebeck measurements [75]. Theoretical studies also suggest that the lowest conduction band of In2O3 is split with Sn doping due to the strong hybridization with dopant s-type states and this splitting contributes to both the decrease of the plasma frequency and the mobility of the carriers [73]. In contrast, calculations of the IMO electronic band structure suggest that high mobility is achievable in degenerate In2O3:Mo as the d-states of Mo do not hybridize with the s-states of In resulting in m* similar to undoped In2O3 [76]. 4.3. Chemical character of impurity dopant element From the descriptions given above, it can be seen that the choice of elements that induce high mobility in TCO materials has largely been empirical. Few if any studies have been conducted to ﬁnd the underlying mechanisms for high mobility caused by speciﬁc dopants. A series of studies predicted that the mobility of doped In2O3 would increase with the Lewis acid strength of the doping element and reported this effect for Ge4+, Si4+ and Sn4+ [77] as well as for Cu, Ti and Zr [78]. However, the µ of the TCO ﬁlms studied generally ranged from 45 cm2V−1s−1 to 55 cm2V−1s−1 and in some cases, the ﬁlms were non-degenerate. In this contribution, we shall attempt to apply the same principles to known degenerately doped In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms with mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1. The Lewis acid strength L can be calculated using a formula developed by Zhang [79] as follows L = Z r2 −7:7χz + 0:8 ð4Þ where r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force due to the oxidation state Z of the ion and χz is the electronegativity of the element in the respective oxidation state. Using this formula, the Lewis acid strengths of elements that are now known to induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms were compiled in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All these ﬁlms presented are highly transparent in the visible and most (where reported) have a high near infra-red region transmission. Generally, it can be seen that the dopants which induce higher mobilities are transition elements which have a higher Lewis acid strength than the host cation. The lists in Tables 2 and 3 are not exhaustive and have been compiled, where possible, from TCO ﬁlms prepared by MOCVD or sputtering, respectively, on glass substrates to reduce the inﬂuence of the ﬁlm deposition technique on the mobility values reported. Also, these ﬁlms may not represent the highest possible mobility achieved by a given dopant. However, most of the dopants listed that induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO are strong Lewis acids compared to Cd2+ and In3+, respectively. There are two exceptions in Table 2, namely H+ and Gd3+. The Lewis acid strength for H+ has not been calculated because of the difﬁculty in determining the ionic radius which is anyway expected to be much less than that of In3+. As mentioned previously, H+ is a shallow donor in most TCO ﬁlms with a high electron afﬁnity, hydrogen may also passivate defect states in In2O3 thus increasing theτ and improving µ [32]. However, the optical properties of H-doped In2O3 have not yet been reported. On the other hand, Gd3+ has a much higher ionic radius and a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ but corresponds to a high mobility of 128 cm2V−1s−1. Gadolinium belongs to a special group of metals known as Lanthanoids, most of which have a partially ﬁled 4f orbital, lying below group three transition metals in the periodic table and hence may warrant further investigation [80]. While doping CdO by Sn4+ and In3+ leads to µ~70 cm2V−1s−1, doping using Y3+ and Ti4+ both transition metal ions results in a drastic increase inµ. We note here that the highest mobility for CdO based material has been observed for a Cd1−XSnXO layer grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgO single crystals, as 609 cm2V−1s−1 and N=4.74×1020cm−3. Sn4+ beinga non-transition metal ion with a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ will induce a lower mobility in In2O3 than the transition elements listed in Table 2. On the other hand, mobility values of <62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with N>1020cm−3 have been reported for nontransition metal dopants with high enough Lewis acid strengths such as Sb5+ (3.559), Ge4+(3.059) and Si4+ (8.098) [77]. According to Wen et al. [77], the high Lewis acid dopants polarise the electronic charge away from the O2−2p valence band more strongly than weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering centre hence increasing the mobility. Similarly, the reason for higher mobility in IMO compared to intrinsic In2O3 has been explained by Mo suppressing scattering by oxygen interstitials [58]. However, if the Lewis acid is too strong e.g. Ge in In2O3, the dopant has a greater afﬁnity to oxygen and may incorporate an excess of oxygen in the lattice which would then limit the µ by the introduction of scattering centres [77]. Originally, the high mobility of IMO was attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+ ions that would contribute three extra electrons to the In2O3 matrix [57]. Later studies by another group suggested that Mo in IMO exists as both Mo4+ and Mo6+ for high carrier density and only as Mo6+ for ﬁlms with lower carrier density [85]. However, since other Table 2 High mobility dopants in In2O3 thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering on glass substrates except where indicated.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 transition elements with a lower oxidation state such as Ti and Zr, etc showhighmobility, ahighoxidationstate isnotnecessarily aconditionfor high mobility. The charge carrier mobility and the visible light transparency of Ti-, Zr-, and Ge-doped In2O3 are much higher than that of ITO for the same dopant atomic concentration [78]. A similar comparison of In2O3 doped by Sn, Ti and Zr, all of which, can have a oxidation state +4 showed that the electron mobility and the NIR transmission were highest for the transition metal dopants [55]. Though the role of possible multiple valency e.g. of Ti as Ti2+ was not considered, these studies asserted that high mobility in In2O3 at least is only exhibited for transition metal dopants. 5. Application of high mobility TCO thin ﬁlms in solar cells At the front of a solar cell, the TCO layer acts as an electrical contact as well as a window to allow light through to the PV absorber layer. At the back of the cell, the TCO usually acts as an interfacial layer to improve the contact resistance between the PV absorber and a metallic reﬂector and also as an optical coupling layer by improving the refractive index matching. In bifacial solar cells, the back contact must act both as an electrical contact and as a window layer to let light through the back of the PV absorber layer. Since high photoconversion efﬁciency in solar cells requires minimal optical and electrical losses, a TCO layer with sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and transparency of >80% over the wavelength spectrum useable by the solar cell is mandatory. High mobility TCO materials are especially desirable where a high transparency of >80% is required over a wide spectral range (400–1300 nm) such as in micro-crystalline silicon, CIGS and other multi-junction solar cells. 5.1. Single junction solar cells High mobility TCO layers can be used as front contact for single junction solar cells in the superstrate conﬁguration because the highest possible process temperatures can be used to optimise the resistivity and transparency. A record efﬁciency of 16.5% for CdTe solar cells has been achieved using CdSnO4 coated glass in the superstrate conﬁguration [86]. Also, an improved light trapping structure for nano-crystalline silicon solar cells using In2O3:Mo layers with a textured ZnO layer can increase the QE for wavelengths exceeding 900 nm compared to cells using ZnO:Al [87]. On the other hand, using In2O3:Ti, a relatively low efﬁciency of 10.7% (compared to state of the art efﬁciency ~20%) has been obtained for CIGS solar cells in the substrate conﬁguration (glass|Mo|CIGS|ZnO|ITiO) [88]. The reason for this low efﬁciency is the high series resistance of the cell caused by high resistivity of the ITiO, since the processing of ITiO could not be done at high temperatures, a problem encountered for all other high mobility TCO ﬁlms as discussed later. 5.2. Bifacial solar cells Bifacial CIGS thin ﬁlm solar cells have been prepared on ITiO coated substrates with improved efﬁciency under rear side illumination as a result of reduced NIR light absorption [89]. However, again here, since the back contact must be highly conductive, a means of processing the HMTCO at low temperature with reasonable conductivity must be developed to realise the full potential of bifacial cells. 5.3. Multi-junction solar cells The top and intermediate solar cells in a multi-junction conﬁguration require a transparent conducting contact at both the front and back of the cell to ensure efﬁcient transmission of unused light to the underlying lower band gap solar cell. CdTe with an optical band gap ~1.45 eV and amorphous silicon ~1.7 eV are examples of solid state absorber materials suitable for upper junctions in multi-junction solar cells. Also, dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) whose spectral response can be adjusted by varying the TiO2 nano-particle size or the sensitising dye, are promising candidates for the top junction in a multi-junction solar cells. CdTe solar cells with a signiﬁcantly high efﬁciency of 13.9% have been developed on Cd2SnO4 coated glass (µ~53.2 cm2V−1s−1, resistivity ρ~1.8×10−4Ω cm) while maintaining a NIR transparency of 50% for the entire device [90]. While a high efﬁciency of the top solar cell is desirable, its full impact on the entire multi-junction solar cell efﬁciency cannot be realised unless the NIR transparency is improved to ensure adequate current matching with the bottom cells [14]. Improvements in NIR transparency through a TCO|CdTe|TCO device structure to values above 60%, require the use of a HMTCO e.g. Mo- or Ti-doped In2O3, at both the front and back sides of the solar cell to reduce parasitic absorption and reﬂection losses [9]. Fig. 5 shows the NIR transmission spectra of identical CdTe solar cells using all IMO or all ITO contacts. There is a signiﬁcant gain in NIR transmission when using IMO contacts for a CdTe solar cell that would act as either a top or an intermediate absorber in a multi-junction solar cell. Such a stack requires that the rear side TCO, which has to be prepared at low temperatures over the absorber layers, is sufﬁciently conductive to prevent losses in the total cell voltage and ﬁll factor which would limit the overall photo-conversion cell efﬁciency. However, high mobility TCOs have been used to improve the total current of a tandem solar cell consisting of an Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell [91]. On the other hand, the TCO layers applied at both the front and rear of a dye sensitised solar cell, can be prepared using high process temperatures without the danger of destroying the mesoscopic TiO2 layers. Taking advantage of this fact, semi-transparent dye sensitised solar cells were prepared using ITiO coated glass for possible application in tandem solar cells [92]. While the NIR transparency increased to 60% compared to DSC devices using FTO coated glass, the efﬁciency was somewhat lower i.e. 5.8% compared to 8.2%, respectively [92]. The reason for the lower efﬁciency was the different growth conditions of the TiO2 interfacial layer on the smoother ITiO ﬁlms (compared to FTO) and on the elevated resistivity of the ITiO after a sintering step at 450 °C in air required to prepare the porous TiO2 absorber. A slight improvement in the DSC efﬁciency to 6.8% could be achieved by adjusting the growth conditions of the dense TiO2 interfacial layer and by heating the entire stack in vacuum after the sintering step in air [93]. The improvement occurred primarily because of increased ﬁll factor resulting from a lower series resistance due to lower resistivity ITiO layers. Heating the ITiO layer in vacuum, desorbs loosely bound oxygen at the surface creating Fig. 5. NIR transmission spectra of two CdTe solar cells, one with all IMO contacts and the other with all ITO contacts. 1845 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 vacancies and oxygen residing along grain boundaries (if the TCO is slightly porous) thus lowering the depletion barrier along the grain boundaries, increasing the charge carrier density while improving the electron mobility, respectively. This “conduction recovery” phenomenon is used for gas sensor application and was reported in 1977 for CdIn2O4 [69] and in the early 1980s for SnO2 [94] and In2O3 [95]. 6. Challenges and prospects In 1999, Coutts et al. [96] outlined key areas of basic research to improve the opto-electronic properties of TCO thin ﬁlms focusing on the development of improved materials which can be easily applied on an industrial scale. While the HMTCO materials reviewed in this article can be prepared with µ of >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 using sputtering and MOCVD which are well developed deposition techniques for industrial fabrication, some challenges still remain. 6.1. Low mobility in TCO ﬁlms prepared with low processing temperature It is desirable to prepare thin ﬁlms at low temperatures to coat plastic substrates or pre-deposited layers of an opto-electronic device with minimal damage, to reduce the energy input into the manufacturing process and to avoid diffusion of undesirable impurities from the substrate into the TCO ﬁlms. We note here that all the low resistivity TCO materials with μ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 in Tables 2 and 3 were prepared with deposition temperatures of at least 300 °C. The typical evolution of the ρ, N and µ values of IMO thin ﬁlms with increasing heater temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The substrate temperature in this case is not more than 10% lower than the heater temperature. These ﬁlms were prepared by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering from a ceramic In2O3:Mo (98:2 wt%) target using argon containing 0.53 vol.% of oxygen at a sputter pressure of 1.0 Pa, with further details reported elsewhere [97]. The resistivity generally reduces as the heater temperature TH increases from 25 °C to 450 °C then saturates at about 2.0×10−4Ω cm at 450 °C and 500 °C. The decrease in resistivity is caused by a concurrent increase in N and µ from 0.6×1020cm−3 to 4.5×1020cm−3 and from 9 cm2V−1s−1 to 73 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Theobservedsuppressionofmobilitytovaluesbelow62.5 cm V−1s−1 at low process temperature of >300 °C, has also been observed by other groups for In2O3:Mo [39,43,45,47,85], In2O3:Ti [45], In2O3:Zr and In2O3: Wo [49]. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for IMO ﬁlms preparedwithoutintentional substrateheatingandwith heatingto500 °C which are described in depth elsewhere [97]. In both cases, the molybdenum exists in the oxidation states of +6 and +4 as well as an intermediate oxidation state +4<x<+6 [98,99]. The ﬁlms grown on heated substrates also contain a small amount of elemental Mo. Though the Mo6+ state is prevalent in both ﬁlms, the Mox+ species are much higher in the low temperature ﬁlm. These Mox+ species are associated withhydroxyls andothercomplex oxides,suchas Mo4O11[99] which may exist as neutral impurities in the ﬁlm and thus reduce the mobility by scattering as has also been reported for In2O3:Sn ﬁlms [34,100]. Additionally, the carrier density of the ﬁlms increases as expected from theory as the Mo6+ species exceeds the sum of the remaining Mo species in the ﬁlm. While this result agrees with some authors [57], other [85] report that the Mo4+ species rather than the Mo6+ contribute to the conduction electrons in IMO. However, both the maximum values of carrier density ~2×1020cm−3 and mobility 44 cm V−1s−1 reported in [85] are less than the corresponding values of 4×1020cm−3 and 73 cm V−1s−1 presented in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, in both cases, the dopant efﬁciency was lower than 100% indicating that some of the charge carriers could be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Table 4 lists the electrical and optical characteristics of IMO, IWO, and ITiO thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating. It can be seen that regardless of the deposition technique, the IMO ﬁlms have μ<25 cm2V−1s−1 which is slightly less than the value reported for degenerate ﬁlms of ITO [101,102] and ZnO:Al [17,103] and much less than that for intrinsic In2O3 [82,104], all deposited without intentional substrate heating. A similar problem is experienced for ﬁlms prepared using the other transition elements as dopants for In2O3 as listed in Table 4. The cause for low µ for ﬁlms prepared at low deposition temperatures is not yet fully understood. This is a major Fig. 6. Resistivity ρ (triangles), Hall mobility µ (circles) and charge carrier density N (squares) of IMO thin ﬁlms as a function of heater temperature. The lines are to guide the eye. Fig. 7. Mo 3d spectra for In2O3:Mo ﬁlms prepared without intentional heating (25°) and with a heater temperature of 500 °C. 1846 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 challenge that precludes the preparation of these high mobility ﬁlms onto heat sensitive substrates. An interesting development is a signiﬁcantly high mobility between 50cm2V−1s−1 and 60cm2V−1s−1 that can be obtained in degenerate amorphous Zn-doped In2O3 ﬁlms prepared without substrate heating [111,112]. These ﬁlms have a relatively high optical transmission in the NIR wavelength region and thus may be an alternative to high mobility TCO materials for coating heat sensitive substrates. It has been proposed that since oxygen vacancies contribute signiﬁcantly to the conductivity of the IZO thin ﬁlms, Zn2+ substitution on In3+ sites does not decrease the carrier density of In2O3 ﬁlms and thus a degenerate carrier density is maintained [104,111]. Further, Zn may increase the density of oxygen vacancies by reducing some of the In–O bonds [104] or by passivating defects caused by interstitial oxygen. The results of the studies mentioned above indicate that the electronic band structure rather than crystalline structure determines the maximum attainable high mobility in TCO materials. 6.2. Inadequate characterisation and analysis methods One of the major problems in studying the limitations of mobility in TCO ﬁlms is the difﬁculty in obtaining sufﬁciently accurate values of effective mass and relaxation times which are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms. Data extracted from optical analysis using Drude's model and the Burstein–Moss shift has to be treated with caution because of the difﬁculties in measuring the ﬁlm thickness to a high enough accuracy and assumptions that the conduction band is parabolic, respectively [8,113]. Young et al. [114] described a four coefﬁcient method used to measure the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients of TCO thin ﬁlms which can be used to determine the charge carrier density, mobility, the effective electron mass, the scattering mechanisms and relaxation time. However, though Hall measurements are widely used, experimental determination of the Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients for these high mobility TCO materials is rarely done, and hence the exact scattering mechanisms limiting the mobility can only be estimated or speculated. Studies on the electronic transport mechanisms reported for HMTCO ﬁlms so far seem to be empirical. Theoretical modelling using either computational chemistry or physics methods is a useful tool for calculating and understanding the structure and properties of materials and may even predict hitherto unknown materials with desirable transparent conducting properties. In particular, more insights into the inﬂuence of dopant chemistry, dopant concentration, and ﬁlm structure on the charge carrier transport mechanisms would aid improvements in the resistivity exhibited by these high mobility TCO materials. Developments in electronic band structure calculations may aid in predicting the material behaviour and can help to elucidate limitations to mobility and doping efﬁciency. For example, a combination of electronic band structure calculations and Seebeck measurements has been used to determine an electron effective mass of Cd2SnO4 around 0.25me [12,75] which is much higher than values of 0.08–0.11me and 0.04me, determined from the Burstein–Moss shift in the 1970s by Nozik [10] and Haacke [115], respectively. However, most of the reported theoretical electronic band structure calculations for HMTCO have focused onCdO ratherthanIn2O3,possiblybecauseofthesimplicityof theformer's rock salt structure. However since In2O3 is less hazardous material and thus more technologically important, more theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure and properties of this material are required to advance the development of TCO materials with improved conductivity. 6.3. Lack of alternative low cost and environmentally benign materials The high mobility with low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm values described in the previous sections have only been observed inmaterials based on In2O3 whichisrathercostlyandCdOwhichispotentiallyhazardousandmaynot be acceptable for environmental reasons. Efforts to dope cheaper and environmentally benign materials with transition elements have not yet resulted in higher mobility e.g. ZnO doped with Zr [116], Ti [117], Mo [33], Ta doped SnO2 [118] and Nb-doped TiO2 [119]. Also, doping ZnO with hydrogen [120] gives a mobility of ~40 cm2V−1s−1 which is comparable withvaluesforAldopingandmuchlessthanthevalueof130 cm2V−1s−1 forH-doped In2O3[32]. Itispossiblethat the wurzite structure of ZnO with tetrahedral coordination is less favourable for electron transport than the cubic structure of CdO and In2O3 both of which have an octahedral coordination [70]. In general, for the same dopant element e.g. tin, the mobility of the ﬁlms increases going from ZnO to In2O3 to CdO as Sn inclusion in ZnO causes disorder in the octahedral causing short relaxation times despite the low effective electron mass [71]. Evidently, to achieve high mobility but cheap and non-hazardous TCO materials, alternative dopants or ternary compounds of ZnO, SnO2 and possibly TiO2, need to be developed and alternative materials that may not necessarily be oxides should be investigated. Single walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNT) are an emerging p-type transparent conducting material that has low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm with transparency of >80% over the visible and near infrared wavelength regions [121]. Promising solar cell efﬁciencies have been achieved on CIGS [122] and on CdTe [123] using SWNT as transparent contacts. Improvements in SWNT for application in PV should be aimed at reducing the relatively high visible light absorption in ﬁlms thicker than 100 nm [121–123]. 6.4. High resistivity despite higher mobility Lastly, despite the elevated values of mobility reported, the resistivity of the In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms has remained similar to that of state of the art ITO thin ﬁlms. A lower than expected dopant activation as well as an upper limit for carrier density above which the mobility begins to reduce has been reported for In2O3:Mo [58,85,124,125], In2O3:W [48,63], In2O3:Zr [52,54] and In2O3:Ti Table 4 A survey of transition element doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating.

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 [44,45]. For the case of In2O3:Mo, it is possible that the reduced dopant activation efﬁciency of Mo is caused by interstitial oxygen forming neutral complexes with some of the Mo at speciﬁc substitutional sites as inferred by some authors [124] and as demonstrated by the XPS measurements discussed in Section 6.1 of this article. Examination of heavily W-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms by Energy-Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed segregation of tungsten at the grain boundaries where it is ineffective as a donor [63]. This implies that the transition element dopants limit the mobility through formation of neutral and impurity scattering centres in much the same way as observed for In2O3:Sn [34,126]. Theoretical modelling and electronic bandstructure calculationsmay beused tounderstand thelimitations to the conductivity of HMTCO ﬁlms and to predict other eligible dopants. However, for accurate and realistic results, the required calculation time as well as the hardware resources increases with the complexity of the host oxides (especially In2O3) and the (transition metal) dopant ions making accurate theoretical calculations difﬁcult. 7. Summary The literature reviewed in this contribution shows that previously stated limits for mobility in low resistivity TCO ﬁlms have been exceeded. Several high mobility TCO materials based on In2O3 and CdO that combine low resistivity with a high visible and near infra-red optical transmission exist, and the highest mobilities attainable continue to be exceeded. Additionally, these materials can be prepared using industrially mature deposition technologies such as sputtering and chemical vapour deposition without signiﬁcant degradation of the opto-electronic properties. Several explanations have been given for the high mobility in speciﬁc In2O3 and CdO based materials but none wholly explain this phenomenon. The application of high mobility TCO layers in various types of thin ﬁlm solar cells has demonstrated their potential to improve the efﬁciency of single junction, multi-junction and bifacial solar cells. However, additional aspects such as thermal stability, formation of suitable interfaces with solar cell absorbers and low temperature growth of low resistivity HMTCO ﬁlms, need to be considered. For large scale production and regardless of the end use, high mobility TCO using alternative cheaper and less hazardous host cation elements than indium and cadmium respectively, are being sought. Other conventional TCO materials based on zinc and tin which are less costly and environmentally benign are still to achieve comparable resistivity and transparency. Additionally, despite the enhanced mobility of HMTCO materials, the resistivity values remain comparable to those of ITO and AZO and the expected reduction to values below 10−4Ω cm is still challenging. Therefore, in the short to medium term, new analysis techniques may be required to learn more about underlying mechanisms for the high mobility in In2O3 and CdO based TCO ﬁlms. In the long term, non-oxide materials may need to be developed while predictions using theoretical methods like electronic band structure calculations may aid in the identiﬁcation of hitherto unknown high mobility transparent conductors.

Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers are characteristically described as thin ﬁlms that exhibit simultaneously high visible wavelength transparency and electrical conductivity. The majority of known TCO materials are n-type semiconductors where defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurity substitutions and interstitials donate electrons to the conduction band providing charge carriers for the ﬂow of electric current [1]. However, hole doping by ionised cation vacancies, impurity acceptor ion substitutions and/or oxygen interstitials which act as electron acceptors is also possible leading to ptype TCO materials [2]. Although p-type TCO materials have been reported, the commonly applied TCO materials are n-type semiconductors namely, F- or Sb-doped tin oxide, Sn- or Zn-doped indium oxide and Al-, B- or Ga-doped zinc oxide. These ﬁlms are used in low emissivity windows, gas sensors, ﬂat panel displays, thin ﬁlm transistors, light emitting diodes and solar cells, to name a few [1,3–7]. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in optimising the preparation of TCO thin ﬁlms for large area depositions required by industry such as increasing the deposition rate, low temperature processing on plastic substrates and improvement of uniformity, among others. However, the resistivity of these ﬁlms has saturated at about 10−4Ωcm though values in the range of 10−5Ωcm can be obtained under controlled laboratory conditions [7]. Other well known TCO materials are In- or Sn-doped CdO which are not widely used because of the hazardous nature of cadmium and a negative public perception against cadmium containing compounds. The resistivity ρ, of a semiconductor is related to the charge carrier density N and the carrier mobility µ by the relation 1 ρ = Nμe ð1Þ where e is the electronic charge given by 1.602×10−19C. If N is increased to reduce ρ, the TCO ﬁlm transmission especially in the near infrared (NIR) region reduces as a result of absorption by free carriers or by metal-like reﬂection. It is therefore, important that further reductions in the TCO resistivity must not adversely reduce the optical transparency of the ﬁlm. However ρ of a TCO ﬁlm may be decreased without reducing the NIR transmission by increasing µ rather than N. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of absorptance in a material with a ﬁxed carrier density (5×1020cm−3) as the mobility increases [8]. Since TCO ﬁlms useful for most applications must have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) which requires a degenerate carrier density ≥10 20cm−3 and ideallyρ<10−3Ωcm, using Eq. (1), the corresponding Hall mobility would be µ≥62.5 cm2V−1s−1. Therefore, in this contribution, high mobility transparent conducting oxides (HMTCO) are used to refer to TCO ﬁlms which fulﬁll the above conditions and have a value of mobility ≥62.5cm2V−1s−1. Ti- and Mo-doped In2O3 (in short, ITiO and IMO respectively) are examples of TCO materials possessing high mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with high NIR transparency while maintaining low ρ~10−4Ωcm. Fig. 2 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra of several thin ﬁlms composed of ITiO, IMO, In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO). The ITiO and IMO ﬁlms were prepared by magnetron sputtering in research laboratory conditions while the ITO and FTO ﬁlms were obtained from commercial vendors, for details refer to a previous study in [9]. The sheet resistance of the ﬁlms ranges from 6 Ω/□to 11 Ω/□and the indium based ﬁlms have a comparable resistivity ρ<2×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is slightly higher at 3.9×10−4Ωcm. While the transmission of the ITO ﬁlm begins to dip at around 950 nm, that of the IMO and ITiO ﬁlms remains high and begins to dip for wavelengths >1200 nm. Though the NIR optical loses may be further reduced by reducing N, doing so indiscriminately can decrease the conductivity and/or the optical band gap of the TCO layer and adversely affect the electrical properties and transparency in the visible wavelength region. Therefore, TCO materials with sufﬁciently high N (≥1020cm−3) while maintaining a high mobility and transparency are desirable. High mobility TCO materials have been prepared in the past but the resistivity has been greater than 10−3Ωcm because of a relatively lowN<10 19cm−3 [10,11]. Such low carrier density levels would require a Hall mobility in the excess of 400 cm2V−1s−1 to achieve ρ<10−4Ω cm. CdO is a well known material with mobility as high as µ = 146 cm2 V−1 s−1 with N=1.5×1020cm−3 [12] but is not suitable for most TCO applications because of absorptioninthe visible light spectrum as a result of a low band gap <3.0 eV and environmental issues. High mobility TCO ﬁlms with a sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and an optical transmission of ≥80% over the visible to NIR wavelengths are potentially useful to enhance solar cell efﬁciency. This is particularly useful in the case of multi-junction solar cells, consisting of stacks of different semiconductors with appropriately matched band gaps to increase the spectral response over a wide wavelength range. Ideally, the bottommost cell should receive photons that are unused by the upper absorbers and thus transmitted through the upper cells including their TCO contacts. Fig. 3 shows a graph comparing the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of single junction solar cells based on absorbers with different optical band gaps and using conventional TCO materials such as ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn as transparent contacts. The EQE curve of the gallium rich CuIn1 −XGaXSe2 (CIGS) cell, labelled C, in Fig. 3 is unexpectedly low for energies above the theoretical band gap because of poor current collection as a result of recombination [13]. Otherwise, for all the solar cells, a signiﬁcant portion of the loss in EQE is caused by optical losses in the front contact TCO. If such solar cell structures are used in a multi-junction device, the amount of light reaching the bottom absorber (with the lowest band gap) is severely reduced causing a current mismatch [14]. When comparing the EQE of the CIS absorber represented by curve A in Fig. 3 with the TCO transmission spectra presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that improvements in the EQE, especially for wavelengths greater than 900 nm are possible if HMTCO contacts are used. Thus, HMTCO ﬁlms could potentially improve the efﬁciency of such solar cells by reducing the optical losses while minimising resistive losses. In this article strategies used to improve the carrier mobility in degenerately doped TCO thin ﬁlms are reviewed. A survey of dopant elements known to improve the mobility of In2O3 and CdO is presented. A discussion aimed at understanding the reasons for high mobility in these materials is given. Examples of the application of HMTCO ﬁlms in solar cells are described and used to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of improved NIR transmission to these devices. Finally, challenges and prospects for further development of HMTCO materials are discussed. 2. Strategies to attain high mobility in TCO materials Various strategies have been employed to increase the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms while maintaining high transparency and conductivity as reviewed by Exarhos and Zhou [15]. Traditionally, the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms has been enhanced by improving the crystalline structure by means such as heat treatment, choice of deposition technique as well as choice of substrate. Here, we expand on some of those strategies and include several other methods that are perhaps less well known, but seem promising. 2.1. Post deposition heat treatment TCO thin ﬁlms prepared without intentional substrate heating or with low process temperatures exhibit low electron mobility as a result of scattering by grain boundaries and/or point defects. Post deposition heat treatment in different ambient conditions reduces point and/or dislocation defects in the amorphous or poorly crystallised TCO ﬁlms by increasing the grain size and improving the overall crystal structure enhancing the electron mobility [3,16]. However, effective heat treatment may require temperatures approaching 1840 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 600 °C, that are unsuitable for heat sensitive substrates such as polymers or even soda lime glass which may soften and introduce undesirable impurities in the TCO ﬁlms and thus other methods have to be used. 2.2. Choice of deposition method While ﬁlm growth by highly energetic particles may increase the grain size of TCO ﬁlms, an excessive transfer of momentum may damage the ﬁlms and reduce the mobility [16]. During sputtering, the discharge voltage at the target surface repels both negative oxygen ions and neutral argon atoms, which arrive at the substrate with high kinetic energy of ~100 eV and distort the TCO crystalline structure [17]. Since the discharge voltage is less for RF sputtering than for DC sputtering, it is usual for TCO ﬁlms grown by the former method to have higher values of mobility [17,18]. The kinetic energy of particles related to pulsed laser deposition varies from 1 eV to a few 100 eV but is easier to control than in sputtering resulting in better TCO crystalline structures leading to higher mobility [19]. 2.3. Control of crystal structure using mono-crystalline substrates Control of crystal growth by using highly oriented substrates is known to enhance the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms by improving crystallinity. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) is often used to grow low resistivity ITO thin ﬁlms [20]. Though the ITO crystal quality can be improved the increase in the mobility is not drastic compared to ITO prepared on glass. Therefore, other factors such as the character of the doping ions may play a role in determining the charge carrier mobility. However, the highest reported mobility for highly conductive ZnO: Al~70 cm2V−1s−1 at N>1020cm−3 has been reported for ﬁlms grown on c-plane sapphire [19]. A study of Cd2SnO4 ﬁlms grown on different substrate illustrates this point further where the mobility of the ﬁlms was measured as 609 cm2V−1s−1 (the highest reported value for a degenerate TCO material), 330 cm2V−1s−1 and 27 cm2V−1s−1 using MgO(111), MgO(100) and boro-silicate glass substrates, respectively [21]. The relatively high cost and limited suitability of these highly oriented substrates on large areas precludes the use of epitaxially grown TCO in a wide range of applications, especially displays and solar cells. 2.4. Controlling impurity concentration Hall mobility in TCO thin ﬁlms can be increased by reducing scattering caused by intrinsic crystalline defects and/or ionised impurities. A relatively high mobility in ZnO:Al up to 44.2 cm2V−1s−1 with N=3.8×1020cm−3 was achieved using a ZnO target with a low Al2O3 concentration of 0.5wt.% [22]. By minimising intrinsic defects in thin ﬁlm ZnO, a mobility of 440 cm2V−1s−1 but with a low N of<1016 cm−3 could be achieved [11]. 2.5. Selective doping methods Selective doping methods may increase the relaxation time in TCO materials by separating the doping and charge transport regions. In such cases, the charge carriers are provided by the heavily doped regions while the lightly doped regions provide a high mobility path where scattering by ionised or neutral impurities, is minimised. Zone conﬁning is achieved by applying a (quasi) periodic temperature gradient across the surface of the substrate during deposition of the TCO material [23]. Fig. 3.

The resistivity values of the indium based ﬁlms range from 1.3×10−4Ωcm to 1.9×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is 3.9×10−4Ωcm. Reproduced with permission from [9]. 1841 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 During ﬁlm growth, the impurities tend to accumulate in the colder areas of the substrate surface. The impurity movement and temperature gradient are mutually parallel and are perpendicular to the growth direction. The result is a ﬁlm consisting of alternate zones of heavily doped metal oxide and almost pure metal oxide (see Fig. 4a). Using this method, a high mobility of 103 cm2V−1s−1 and an average carrier density of 1.4×1021cm−3 give a resistivity of 4.4×10−5Ω cm for ITO [23,24]. However, the visible transparency of ITO prepared using this method including the substrate, was below 80% [24]. Selective doping using multi-layered ﬁlms composed of lightly and heavily doped semiconductors alternately stacked in the direction of the ﬁlm growth (see Fig. 4b), is also referred to as modulation doping [25]. Several studies predict that modulation doping may improve TCO mobility [26,27]. Simulations on multi-layered ﬁlms composed of InGaO3 (relatively large electron afﬁnity and low carrier density) alternately stacked with ZnO:Al layers (low electron afﬁnity and high carrier density) have predicted that high conductivity >4.2×104S cm−1 for carrier densities ~1020cm−3 are possible [26]. Simulations of the transport mechanisms revealed that the conductivity is very sensitive to the quantum well thickness. The authors proposed that high mobilities derived from doping modulation would require individual layers of <5 nm thick and high crystal quality materials with close lattice matching in order to avoid interface defects which would be challenging to achieve in practice [26]. A mobility of 1560 cm V−1s−1 is possible if N=1×1020cm−3 at the bottom of a 5 nm wide quantum well giving a resistivity of 4.0×10−5Ω cm. A similar simulation was performed for modulation-doped multi-layers composed of ZnO|ZnMgO|ZnMgO:Al| ZnMgO all of which are closely lattice matched [26]. Mobilities as high as 145 cm2V−1s−1 were predicted for a structure with an average carrier density of 3.8×1018cm−3 but the lowest resistivity was limited to 1.5×10−3Ω cm. Multi-layers consisting of ZnO|ZnO:Al and ZnO|Zn1−X MgXO:Al have also been prepared on a- and c-plane sapphire substrates and though the crystal structure was comparable to that of single layers, the resistivity was quite high [28]. The authors attributed this effect to the high oxidation sensitivity of the thin ﬁlms which passivated the donors and reduced the carrier density. Also, multi-layered ﬁlms consisting of the dopant oxide ﬁlms alternating with the host cation oxide have been prepared, i.e. InOX (2.0 nm)|SnOY (0.2 nm) obtaining a relatively low mobility of 17 cm2V−1s−1 and a carrier density of 5×1020cm−3 [29]. To date, the predicted high mobility cannot be obtained in thin ﬁlms prepared by modulation doping as desired for most TCO applications such as photovoltaic cells. 2.6. Hydrogen inclusion Total energy calculations based on ﬁrst principles suggest that the bond length between hydrogen and the nearest host oxygen atom in a metal oxide is virtually the same regardless of the metal [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen is “pinned” at a ﬁxed energy level which introduces shallow defect states inside the conduction band of oxides with a high electron afﬁnity leading to n-type doping. It has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates structural defects in TCO materials in the same way as is well known for thin ﬁlm silicon [31,32]. Hydrogen inclusion in TCO materials is achieved either during ﬁlm deposition or by post deposition annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. One of the highest mobilities for ITO (μ~145 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been achieved by post deposition treatment in a hydrogen plasma [32] while that for ZnO:Al (μ~50 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been reported for ﬁlms sputtered with a small amount of hydrogen added to the sputter gas [33]. A high value of µ=130 cm2V−1s−1 for N=1.8×1020cm−3 has also been reported for hydrogen doped In2O3 [32]. 2.7. Choice of appropriate dopants The highest mobilities achieved for conventional degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering are typically 40–50 cm2V−1s−1 for ITO [16,34,35] and ZnO:Al [7,17]. However, speciﬁc elements have been used to prepare degenerate CdO and In2O3 thin ﬁlms by sputtering with µ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with transmission of >80% in the visible and near infra-red wavelength regions. While undoped CdO thin ﬁlms have a high mobility, the optical band gap is too low for use as a transparent conductor for visible light. However, doping cadmium oxide with several elements e.g. In [12], Sc [36], Y [37] and Ti [38] can lead to mobilities above 62.5 cm2V−1s−1 while maintaining N≥1020cm−3. A wider range of doping elements has been used to achieve high mobility in In2O3 thin ﬁlms such as Mo [39–41], Ti [42–47], W [48–51], Zr [42,43,52–55], and Gd [56]. Details of dopants elements leading to high mobility in CdO and In2O3 are presented later in Section 4.3. 3. Deposition methods for degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms with mobility higher than 62 cm2V−1s−1 Impurity doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms with high mobility can be prepared using a variety of methods as listed in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that though high mobility in impurity doped In2O3 can be achieved by a wide range of deposition techniques, the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and/or post deposition annealing further enhances the Hall mobility. The lowest resistivity reported for IMO thin ﬁlms to date is 6.7×10−5Ω cm with a high mobility (250cm2V−1s−1) grown at 500 °C byPLD onquartz[41]. However, the NIR opticaltransmissionis not known as a high transmittance (~90%) was only presented for visible light. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of high mobility in impurity doped CdO and In2O3 The mobility µ of an electron in semiconductors depends on the relaxation time τ, the electronic charge e and the effective carrier mass m* in the conduction band as given by the following relationship μ = eτ m* : ð2Þ Therefore, the mobility can be increased by increasing τ or by decreasing m*. Increasing τ requires ﬁlms with fewer defects which may be achieved by lower carrier density, less grain boundaries and less neutral impurities. Decreasing m*, requires semiconductors with a widely dispersed conduction band. The scattering mechanisms that govern the electron transport in semiconductors are described in detail in text books such as that by Lundstrom [64]. Of these, the scattering mechanisms relevant to ntype TCO thin ﬁlms have been identiﬁed by other authors [3,65–67]. Brieﬂy, they are: i. Grain boundary scattering caused by the discontinuity presented by grain boundaries especially in polycrystalline thin ﬁlm Fig. 4. Schematic showing charge carrier distributions in relation to the direction of ﬁlm growth of semiconductors prepared using selective doping by zone conﬁning (a) and modulation (b). The dark and light sections denote regions of high and low carrier density, respectively. 1842 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 materials. A space charge region formed around the grain boundaries and the resulting potential barrier scatters the electrons crossing this region reducing the mobility. Grain boundary scattering only signiﬁcantly affects the overall TCO mobility if the grain size is about the same as the mean free path of the charge carriers. ii. Ionised impurity scattering caused by deﬂection of free carriers by the long-range electrostatic ﬁelds associated with intentional dopants and defects such as interstitials and vacancies. iii. Optical phonon scattering caused by lattice vibrations of bonds in a polar semiconductor which induce an electric ﬁeld that interacts with a charge moving through the lattice. iv. Acoustic-phonon scattering caused by an acoustic wave propagation through a crystal lattice which causes the atoms to oscillate about their equilibrium positions and interfere with the electron motion. v. Neutral impurity scattering caused by non-ionised impurities. vi. Piezoelectric scattering which arises from electric ﬁelds caused by the strain associated with lattice vibrations in crystals where partially ionic bonds occur such that the unit cell does not contain a centre of symmetry. Matthiesen's rule states that the contribution of different scattering processes to the mobility and thus carrier transport is additive provided that the scattering mechanisms are independent [64]. Therefore for the above scattering processes, the overall mobility is given by the following relation. 1 μ = ∑ n i=1 1 μi ð3Þ where µi is the mobility due to the ith scattering mechanism. In practice, the conductivity of TCO materials cannot be increased by simultaneously increasing the carrier density and the mobility. Usually, the mobility is observed to saturate and even start to reduce as the carrier density is increased indicating dominant scattering by ionised impurities. Normally, grain boundary scattering is dominant for N≤1019cm−3 while charge impurity scattering is more signiﬁcant for N≥1019cm−3 for ITO and ZnO:Al [1,28,34,66,68]. Recent studies also suggest that for N>1019cm−3, the nature of the scattering differs for both ITO and ZnO:Al as a result of the piezoelectricity of the latter material leading to higher trap densities [66]. 4.1. Role of crystalline quality and structure Poor crystalline quality may cause a reduction in the relaxation time and thus mobility as a result of increased point defects, grain boundaries and lattice distortion. Electron transport in n-type semiconductor is facilitated by the vacant s-orbitals of neighbouring cations in the crystal lattice overlapping to form a conduction path. Moreover, if the crystal structure is disrupted by say, a cation vacancy, the spatial spread of the vacant s-orbital around that site is disrupted causing the effective mass of the electron to increase thus reducing its mobility. Therefore, shorter cation–cation bond length and a favourable distribution of the cations are believed to increase the mobility of the electrons in the semiconductor. Early work by Shannon [69] on single crystals in the CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family revealed that oxide structures with continuous edge sharing of cation octahedra are essential for conductivity in metal oxides. Later work by Ingram et al. [70] on thin ﬁlms of the same CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family extended this rule to include structures where octahedra share corners. They also classiﬁed TCO materials according to the coordination of the cations e.g. ZnO has tetrahedral coordination, while CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and other Cd containing spinel oxides have octahedral coordination. The decrease in both conductivity and mobility was also correlated to a decrease in the octahedral cation density in the structure in the order: CdO (rock salt)>In2O3 (bixbyite)>SnO2 (rutile) [70]. Studies of ZnSnO4 by Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that the unusually low mobility is a result of disorder on the cation octahedral sites which may disrupt transport between edge sharing cations [71]. Therefore, since high mobility with degenerate doping has only been reported for CdO and In2O3 based compounds with octahedrally coordinated cations, the associated cubic structure may also favour high mobility. 4.2. Role of the electronic band structure The electronic band structure of TCO materials can be studied by theoretical modelling or by measurements of the relaxation time and effective mass as well as the Hall parameters. Owing to the simple structure of CdO, the majority of theoretical electronic band structure studies have been done on this material. Freeman et al. [72,73] have identiﬁed three salient features of the electronic band structure of the conduction band of a TCO material which affect the charge carrier transport mechanisms namely, the curvature, the dispersion and the position. A parabolic conduction band minimum ensures a low effective carrier mass of the electrons which promotes high mobility. A study of the Cd1+XIn2−2XSnXO4 system shows that both the density of states effective mass and the relaxation time increase with N resulting in a cancellation effect such that the mobility is less than expected [74].

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 contrast, the effective carrier mass of IMO was determined as 0.32me and found to be independent of N implying a parabolic conduction band minimum[58].A widely dispersed conduction band minimum allows the drift of electrons unimpeded through the crystal structure resulting in a higher relaxation time and thus higher mobility. Electronic band structure calculations of InXCd1−XO thin ﬁlms for which mobility up to 91.5 cm2V−1s−1 withN>1020cm−3 was measured, revealed an electron effective mass of 0.24–0.26me and a broadening of the conduction band edge by hybridization of the Cd 5s and In 5s bands [12]. The calculated effective electron mass agrees with a value of 0.25me determined by Seebeck measurements [75]. Theoretical studies also suggest that the lowest conduction band of In2O3 is split with Sn doping due to the strong hybridization with dopant s-type states and this splitting contributes to both the decrease of the plasma frequency and the mobility of the carriers [73]. In contrast, calculations of the IMO electronic band structure suggest that high mobility is achievable in degenerate In2O3:Mo as the d-states of Mo do not hybridize with the s-states of In resulting in m* similar to undoped In2O3 [76]. 4.3. Chemical character of impurity dopant element From the descriptions given above, it can be seen that the choice of elements that induce high mobility in TCO materials has largely been empirical. Few if any studies have been conducted to ﬁnd the underlying mechanisms for high mobility caused by speciﬁc dopants. A series of studies predicted that the mobility of doped In2O3 would increase with the Lewis acid strength of the doping element and reported this effect for Ge4+, Si4+ and Sn4+ [77] as well as for Cu, Ti and Zr [78]. However, the µ of the TCO ﬁlms studied generally ranged from 45 cm2V−1s−1 to 55 cm2V−1s−1 and in some cases, the ﬁlms were non-degenerate. In this contribution, we shall attempt to apply the same principles to known degenerately doped In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms with mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1. The Lewis acid strength L can be calculated using a formula developed by Zhang [79] as follows L = Z r2 −7:7χz + 0:8 ð4Þ where r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force due to the oxidation state Z of the ion and χz is the electronegativity of the element in the respective oxidation state. Using this formula, the Lewis acid strengths of elements that are now known to induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms were compiled in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All these ﬁlms presented are highly transparent in the visible and most (where reported) have a high near infra-red region transmission. Generally, it can be seen that the dopants which induce higher mobilities are transition elements which have a higher Lewis acid strength than the host cation. The lists in Tables 2 and 3 are not exhaustive and have been compiled, where possible, from TCO ﬁlms prepared by MOCVD or sputtering, respectively, on glass substrates to reduce the inﬂuence of the ﬁlm deposition technique on the mobility values reported. Also, these ﬁlms may not represent the highest possible mobility achieved by a given dopant. However, most of the dopants listed that induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO are strong Lewis acids compared to Cd2+ and In3+, respectively. There are two exceptions in Table 2, namely H+ and Gd3+. The Lewis acid strength for H+ has not been calculated because of the difﬁculty in determining the ionic radius which is anyway expected to be much less than that of In3+. As mentioned previously, H+ is a shallow donor in most TCO ﬁlms with a high electron afﬁnity, hydrogen may also passivate defect states in In2O3 thus increasing theτ and improving µ [32]. However, the optical properties of H-doped In2O3 have not yet been reported. On the other hand, Gd3+ has a much higher ionic radius and a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ but corresponds to a high mobility of 128 cm2V−1s−1. Gadolinium belongs to a special group of metals known as Lanthanoids, most of which have a partially ﬁled 4f orbital, lying below group three transition metals in the periodic table and hence may warrant further investigation [80]. While doping CdO by Sn4+ and In3+ leads to µ~70 cm2V−1s−1, doping using Y3+ and Ti4+ both transition metal ions results in a drastic increase inµ. We note here that the highest mobility for CdO based material has been observed for a Cd1−XSnXO layer grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgO single crystals, as 609 cm2V−1s−1 and N=4.74×1020cm−3. Sn4+ beinga non-transition metal ion with a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ will induce a lower mobility in In2O3 than the transition elements listed in Table 2. On the other hand, mobility values of <62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with N>1020cm−3 have been reported for nontransition metal dopants with high enough Lewis acid strengths such as Sb5+ (3.559), Ge4+(3.059) and Si4+ (8.098) [77]. According to Wen et al. [77], the high Lewis acid dopants polarise the electronic charge away from the O2−2p valence band more strongly than weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering centre hence increasing the mobility. Similarly, the reason for higher mobility in IMO compared to intrinsic In2O3 has been explained by Mo suppressing scattering by oxygen interstitials [58]. However, if the Lewis acid is too strong e.g. Ge in In2O3, the dopant has a greater afﬁnity to oxygen and may incorporate an excess of oxygen in the lattice which would then limit the µ by the introduction of scattering centres [77]. Originally, the high mobility of IMO was attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+ ions that would contribute three extra electrons to the In2O3 matrix [57]. Later studies by another group suggested that Mo in IMO exists as both Mo4+ and Mo6+ for high carrier density and only as Mo6+ for ﬁlms with lower carrier density [85]. However, since other Table 2 High mobility dopants in In2O3 thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering on glass substrates except where indicated.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 transition elements with a lower oxidation state such as Ti and Zr, etc showhighmobility, ahighoxidationstate isnotnecessarily aconditionfor high mobility. The charge carrier mobility and the visible light transparency of Ti-, Zr-, and Ge-doped In2O3 are much higher than that of ITO for the same dopant atomic concentration [78]. A similar comparison of In2O3 doped by Sn, Ti and Zr, all of which, can have a oxidation state +4 showed that the electron mobility and the NIR transmission were highest for the transition metal dopants [55]. Though the role of possible multiple valency e.g. of Ti as Ti2+ was not considered, these studies asserted that high mobility in In2O3 at least is only exhibited for transition metal dopants. 5. Application of high mobility TCO thin ﬁlms in solar cells At the front of a solar cell, the TCO layer acts as an electrical contact as well as a window to allow light through to the PV absorber layer. At the back of the cell, the TCO usually acts as an interfacial layer to improve the contact resistance between the PV absorber and a metallic reﬂector and also as an optical coupling layer by improving the refractive index matching. In bifacial solar cells, the back contact must act both as an electrical contact and as a window layer to let light through the back of the PV absorber layer. Since high photoconversion efﬁciency in solar cells requires minimal optical and electrical losses, a TCO layer with sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and transparency of >80% over the wavelength spectrum useable by the solar cell is mandatory. High mobility TCO materials are especially desirable where a high transparency of >80% is required over a wide spectral range (400–1300 nm) such as in micro-crystalline silicon, CIGS and other multi-junction solar cells. 5.1. Single junction solar cells High mobility TCO layers can be used as front contact for single junction solar cells in the superstrate conﬁguration because the highest possible process temperatures can be used to optimise the resistivity and transparency. A record efﬁciency of 16.5% for CdTe solar cells has been achieved using CdSnO4 coated glass in the superstrate conﬁguration [86]. Also, an improved light trapping structure for nano-crystalline silicon solar cells using In2O3:Mo layers with a textured ZnO layer can increase the QE for wavelengths exceeding 900 nm compared to cells using ZnO:Al [87]. On the other hand, using In2O3:Ti, a relatively low efﬁciency of 10.7% (compared to state of the art efﬁciency ~20%) has been obtained for CIGS solar cells in the substrate conﬁguration (glass|Mo|CIGS|ZnO|ITiO) [88]. The reason for this low efﬁciency is the high series resistance of the cell caused by high resistivity of the ITiO, since the processing of ITiO could not be done at high temperatures, a problem encountered for all other high mobility TCO ﬁlms as discussed later. 5.2. Bifacial solar cells Bifacial CIGS thin ﬁlm solar cells have been prepared on ITiO coated substrates with improved efﬁciency under rear side illumination as a result of reduced NIR light absorption [89]. However, again here, since the back contact must be highly conductive, a means of processing the HMTCO at low temperature with reasonable conductivity must be developed to realise the full potential of bifacial cells. 5.3. Multi-junction solar cells The top and intermediate solar cells in a multi-junction conﬁguration require a transparent conducting contact at both the front and back of the cell to ensure efﬁcient transmission of unused light to the underlying lower band gap solar cell. CdTe with an optical band gap ~1.45 eV and amorphous silicon ~1.7 eV are examples of solid state absorber materials suitable for upper junctions in multi-junction solar cells. Also, dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) whose spectral response can be adjusted by varying the TiO2 nano-particle size or the sensitising dye, are promising candidates for the top junction in a multi-junction solar cells. CdTe solar cells with a signiﬁcantly high efﬁciency of 13.9% have been developed on Cd2SnO4 coated glass (µ~53.2 cm2V−1s−1, resistivity ρ~1.8×10−4Ω cm) while maintaining a NIR transparency of 50% for the entire device [90]. While a high efﬁciency of the top solar cell is desirable, its full impact on the entire multi-junction solar cell efﬁciency cannot be realised unless the NIR transparency is improved to ensure adequate current matching with the bottom cells [14]. Improvements in NIR transparency through a TCO|CdTe|TCO device structure to values above 60%, require the use of a HMTCO e.g. Mo- or Ti-doped In2O3, at both the front and back sides of the solar cell to reduce parasitic absorption and reﬂection losses [9]. Fig. 5 shows the NIR transmission spectra of identical CdTe solar cells using all IMO or all ITO contacts. There is a signiﬁcant gain in NIR transmission when using IMO contacts for a CdTe solar cell that would act as either a top or an intermediate absorber in a multi-junction solar cell. Such a stack requires that the rear side TCO, which has to be prepared at low temperatures over the absorber layers, is sufﬁciently conductive to prevent losses in the total cell voltage and ﬁll factor which would limit the overall photo-conversion cell efﬁciency. However, high mobility TCOs have been used to improve the total current of a tandem solar cell consisting of an Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell [91]. On the other hand, the TCO layers applied at both the front and rear of a dye sensitised solar cell, can be prepared using high process temperatures without the danger of destroying the mesoscopic TiO2 layers. Taking advantage of this fact, semi-transparent dye sensitised solar cells were prepared using ITiO coated glass for possible application in tandem solar cells [92]. While the NIR transparency increased to 60% compared to DSC devices using FTO coated glass, the efﬁciency was somewhat lower i.e. 5.8% compared to 8.2%, respectively [92]. The reason for the lower efﬁciency was the different growth conditions of the TiO2 interfacial layer on the smoother ITiO ﬁlms (compared to FTO) and on the elevated resistivity of the ITiO after a sintering step at 450 °C in air required to prepare the porous TiO2 absorber. A slight improvement in the DSC efﬁciency to 6.8% could be achieved by adjusting the growth conditions of the dense TiO2 interfacial layer and by heating the entire stack in vacuum after the sintering step in air [93]. The improvement occurred primarily because of increased ﬁll factor resulting from a lower series resistance due to lower resistivity ITiO layers. Heating the ITiO layer in vacuum, desorbs loosely bound oxygen at the surface creating Fig. 5. NIR transmission spectra of two CdTe solar cells, one with all IMO contacts and the other with all ITO contacts. 1845 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 vacancies and oxygen residing along grain boundaries (if the TCO is slightly porous) thus lowering the depletion barrier along the grain boundaries, increasing the charge carrier density while improving the electron mobility, respectively. This “conduction recovery” phenomenon is used for gas sensor application and was reported in 1977 for CdIn2O4 [69] and in the early 1980s for SnO2 [94] and In2O3 [95]. 6. Challenges and prospects In 1999, Coutts et al. [96] outlined key areas of basic research to improve the opto-electronic properties of TCO thin ﬁlms focusing on the development of improved materials which can be easily applied on an industrial scale. While the HMTCO materials reviewed in this article can be prepared with µ of >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 using sputtering and MOCVD which are well developed deposition techniques for industrial fabrication, some challenges still remain. 6.1. Low mobility in TCO ﬁlms prepared with low processing temperature It is desirable to prepare thin ﬁlms at low temperatures to coat plastic substrates or pre-deposited layers of an opto-electronic device with minimal damage, to reduce the energy input into the manufacturing process and to avoid diffusion of undesirable impurities from the substrate into the TCO ﬁlms. We note here that all the low resistivity TCO materials with μ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 in Tables 2 and 3 were prepared with deposition temperatures of at least 300 °C. The typical evolution of the ρ, N and µ values of IMO thin ﬁlms with increasing heater temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The substrate temperature in this case is not more than 10% lower than the heater temperature. These ﬁlms were prepared by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering from a ceramic In2O3:Mo (98:2 wt%) target using argon containing 0.53 vol.% of oxygen at a sputter pressure of 1.0 Pa, with further details reported elsewhere [97]. The resistivity generally reduces as the heater temperature TH increases from 25 °C to 450 °C then saturates at about 2.0×10−4Ω cm at 450 °C and 500 °C. The decrease in resistivity is caused by a concurrent increase in N and µ from 0.6×1020cm−3 to 4.5×1020cm−3 and from 9 cm2V−1s−1 to 73 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Theobservedsuppressionofmobilitytovaluesbelow62.5 cm V−1s−1 at low process temperature of >300 °C, has also been observed by other groups for In2O3:Mo [39,43,45,47,85], In2O3:Ti [45], In2O3:Zr and In2O3: Wo [49]. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for IMO ﬁlms preparedwithoutintentional substrateheatingandwith heatingto500 °C which are described in depth elsewhere [97]. In both cases, the molybdenum exists in the oxidation states of +6 and +4 as well as an intermediate oxidation state +4<x<+6 [98,99]. The ﬁlms grown on heated substrates also contain a small amount of elemental Mo. Though the Mo6+ state is prevalent in both ﬁlms, the Mox+ species are much higher in the low temperature ﬁlm. These Mox+ species are associated withhydroxyls andothercomplex oxides,suchas Mo4O11[99] which may exist as neutral impurities in the ﬁlm and thus reduce the mobility by scattering as has also been reported for In2O3:Sn ﬁlms [34,100]. Additionally, the carrier density of the ﬁlms increases as expected from theory as the Mo6+ species exceeds the sum of the remaining Mo species in the ﬁlm. While this result agrees with some authors [57], other [85] report that the Mo4+ species rather than the Mo6+ contribute to the conduction electrons in IMO. However, both the maximum values of carrier density ~2×1020cm−3 and mobility 44 cm V−1s−1 reported in [85] are less than the corresponding values of 4×1020cm−3 and 73 cm V−1s−1 presented in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, in both cases, the dopant efﬁciency was lower than 100% indicating that some of the charge carriers could be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Table 4 lists the electrical and optical characteristics of IMO, IWO, and ITiO thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating. It can be seen that regardless of the deposition technique, the IMO ﬁlms have μ<25 cm2V−1s−1 which is slightly less than the value reported for degenerate ﬁlms of ITO [101,102] and ZnO:Al [17,103] and much less than that for intrinsic In2O3 [82,104], all deposited without intentional substrate heating. A similar problem is experienced for ﬁlms prepared using the other transition elements as dopants for In2O3 as listed in Table 4. The cause for low µ for ﬁlms prepared at low deposition temperatures is not yet fully understood. This is a major Fig. 6. Resistivity ρ (triangles), Hall mobility µ (circles) and charge carrier density N (squares) of IMO thin ﬁlms as a function of heater temperature. The lines are to guide the eye. Fig. 7.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 challenge that precludes the preparation of these high mobility ﬁlms onto heat sensitive substrates. An interesting development is a signiﬁcantly high mobility between 50cm2V−1s−1 and 60cm2V−1s−1 that can be obtained in degenerate amorphous Zn-doped In2O3 ﬁlms prepared without substrate heating [111,112]. These ﬁlms have a relatively high optical transmission in the NIR wavelength region and thus may be an alternative to high mobility TCO materials for coating heat sensitive substrates. It has been proposed that since oxygen vacancies contribute signiﬁcantly to the conductivity of the IZO thin ﬁlms, Zn2+ substitution on In3+ sites does not decrease the carrier density of In2O3 ﬁlms and thus a degenerate carrier density is maintained [104,111]. Further, Zn may increase the density of oxygen vacancies by reducing some of the In–O bonds [104] or by passivating defects caused by interstitial oxygen. The results of the studies mentioned above indicate that the electronic band structure rather than crystalline structure determines the maximum attainable high mobility in TCO materials. 6.2. Inadequate characterisation and analysis methods One of the major problems in studying the limitations of mobility in TCO ﬁlms is the difﬁculty in obtaining sufﬁciently accurate values of effective mass and relaxation times which are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms. Data extracted from optical analysis using Drude's model and the Burstein–Moss shift has to be treated with caution because of the difﬁculties in measuring the ﬁlm thickness to a high enough accuracy and assumptions that the conduction band is parabolic, respectively [8,113]. Young et al. [114] described a four coefﬁcient method used to measure the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients of TCO thin ﬁlms which can be used to determine the charge carrier density, mobility, the effective electron mass, the scattering mechanisms and relaxation time. However, though Hall measurements are widely used, experimental determination of the Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients for these high mobility TCO materials is rarely done, and hence the exact scattering mechanisms limiting the mobility can only be estimated or speculated. Studies on the electronic transport mechanisms reported for HMTCO ﬁlms so far seem to be empirical. Theoretical modelling using either computational chemistry or physics methods is a useful tool for calculating and understanding the structure and properties of materials and may even predict hitherto unknown materials with desirable transparent conducting properties. In particular, more insights into the inﬂuence of dopant chemistry, dopant concentration, and ﬁlm structure on the charge carrier transport mechanisms would aid improvements in the resistivity exhibited by these high mobility TCO materials. Developments in electronic band structure calculations may aid in predicting the material behaviour and can help to elucidate limitations to mobility and doping efﬁciency. For example, a combination of electronic band structure calculations and Seebeck measurements has been used to determine an electron effective mass of Cd2SnO4 around 0.25me [12,75] which is much higher than values of 0.08–0.11me and 0.04me, determined from the Burstein–Moss shift in the 1970s by Nozik [10] and Haacke [115], respectively. However, most of the reported theoretical electronic band structure calculations for HMTCO have focused onCdO ratherthanIn2O3,possiblybecauseofthesimplicityof theformer's rock salt structure. However since In2O3 is less hazardous material and thus more technologically important, more theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure and properties of this material are required to advance the development of TCO materials with improved conductivity. 6.3. Lack of alternative low cost and environmentally benign materials The high mobility with low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm values described in the previous sections have only been observed inmaterials based on In2O3 whichisrathercostlyandCdOwhichispotentiallyhazardousandmaynot be acceptable for environmental reasons. Efforts to dope cheaper and environmentally benign materials with transition elements have not yet resulted in higher mobility e.g. ZnO doped with Zr [116], Ti [117], Mo [33], Ta doped SnO2 [118] and Nb-doped TiO2 [119]. Also, doping ZnO with hydrogen [120] gives a mobility of ~40 cm2V−1s−1 which is comparable withvaluesforAldopingandmuchlessthanthevalueof130 cm2V−1s−1 forH-doped In2O3[32]. Itispossiblethat the wurzite structure of ZnO with tetrahedral coordination is less favourable for electron transport than the cubic structure of CdO and In2O3 both of which have an octahedral coordination [70]. In general, for the same dopant element e.g. tin, the mobility of the ﬁlms increases going from ZnO to In2O3 to CdO as Sn inclusion in ZnO causes disorder in the octahedral causing short relaxation times despite the low effective electron mass [71]. Evidently, to achieve high mobility but cheap and non-hazardous TCO materials, alternative dopants or ternary compounds of ZnO, SnO2 and possibly TiO2, need to be developed and alternative materials that may not necessarily be oxides should be investigated. Single walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNT) are an emerging p-type transparent conducting material that has low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm with transparency of >80% over the visible and near infrared wavelength regions [121]. Promising solar cell efﬁciencies have been achieved on CIGS [122] and on CdTe [123] using SWNT as transparent contacts. Improvements in SWNT for application in PV should be aimed at reducing the relatively high visible light absorption in ﬁlms thicker than 100 nm [121–123]. 6.4. High resistivity despite higher mobility Lastly, despite the elevated values of mobility reported, the resistivity of the In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms has remained similar to that of state of the art ITO thin ﬁlms. A lower than expected dopant activation as well as an upper limit for carrier density above which the mobility begins to reduce has been reported for In2O3:Mo [58,85,124,125], In2O3:W [48,63], In2O3:Zr [52,54] and In2O3:Ti Table 4 A survey of transition element doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating.

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 [44,45]. For the case of In2O3:Mo, it is possible that the reduced dopant activation efﬁciency of Mo is caused by interstitial oxygen forming neutral complexes with some of the Mo at speciﬁc substitutional sites as inferred by some authors [124] and as demonstrated by the XPS measurements discussed in Section 6.1 of this article. Examination of heavily W-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms by Energy-Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed segregation of tungsten at the grain boundaries where it is ineffective as a donor [63]. This implies that the transition element dopants limit the mobility through formation of neutral and impurity scattering centres in much the same way as observed for In2O3:Sn [34,126]. Theoretical modelling and electronic bandstructure calculationsmay beused tounderstand thelimitations to the conductivity of HMTCO ﬁlms and to predict other eligible dopants. However, for accurate and realistic results, the required calculation time as well as the hardware resources increases with the complexity of the host oxides (especially In2O3) and the (transition metal) dopant ions making accurate theoretical calculations difﬁcult. 7. Summary The literature reviewed in this contribution shows that previously stated limits for mobility in low resistivity TCO ﬁlms have been exceeded. Several high mobility TCO materials based on In2O3 and CdO that combine low resistivity with a high visible and near infra-red optical transmission exist, and the highest mobilities attainable continue to be exceeded. Additionally, these materials can be prepared using industrially mature deposition technologies such as sputtering and chemical vapour deposition without signiﬁcant degradation of the opto-electronic properties. Several explanations have been given for the high mobility in speciﬁc In2O3 and CdO based materials but none wholly explain this phenomenon. The application of high mobility TCO layers in various types of thin ﬁlm solar cells has demonstrated their potential to improve the efﬁciency of single junction, multi-junction and bifacial solar cells. However, additional aspects such as thermal stability, formation of suitable interfaces with solar cell absorbers and low temperature growth of low resistivity HMTCO ﬁlms, need to be considered. For large scale production and regardless of the end use, high mobility TCO using alternative cheaper and less hazardous host cation elements than indium and cadmium respectively, are being sought. Other conventional TCO materials based on zinc and tin which are less costly and environmentally benign are still to achieve comparable resistivity and transparency. Additionally, despite the enhanced mobility of HMTCO materials, the resistivity values remain comparable to those of ITO and AZO and the expected reduction to values below 10−4Ω cm is still challenging. Therefore, in the short to medium term, new analysis techniques may be required to learn more about underlying mechanisms for the high mobility in In2O3 and CdO based TCO ﬁlms. In the long term, non-oxide materials may need to be developed while predictions using theoretical methods like electronic band structure calculations may aid in the identiﬁcation of hitherto unknown high mobility transparent conductors.

Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers are characteristically described as thin ﬁlms that exhibit simultaneously high visible wavelength transparency and electrical conductivity. The majority of known TCO materials are n-type semiconductors where defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurity substitutions and interstitials donate electrons to the conduction band providing charge carriers for the ﬂow of electric current [1]. However, hole doping by ionised cation vacancies, impurity acceptor ion substitutions and/or oxygen interstitials which act as electron acceptors is also possible leading to ptype TCO materials [2]. Although p-type TCO materials have been reported, the commonly applied TCO materials are n-type semiconductors namely, F- or Sb-doped tin oxide, Sn- or Zn-doped indium oxide and Al-, B- or Ga-doped zinc oxide. These ﬁlms are used in low emissivity windows, gas sensors, ﬂat panel displays, thin ﬁlm transistors, light emitting diodes and solar cells, to name a few [1,3–7]. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in optimising the preparation of TCO thin ﬁlms for large area depositions required by industry such as increasing the deposition rate, low temperature processing on plastic substrates and improvement of uniformity, among others. However, the resistivity of these ﬁlms has saturated at about 10−4Ωcm though values in the range of 10−5Ωcm can be obtained under controlled laboratory conditions [7]. Other well known TCO materials are In- or Sn-doped CdO which are not widely used because of the hazardous nature of cadmium and a negative public perception against cadmium containing compounds. The resistivity ρ, of a semiconductor is related to the charge carrier density N and the carrier mobility µ by the relation 1 ρ = Nμe ð1Þ where e is the electronic charge given by 1.602×10−19C. If N is increased to reduce ρ, the TCO ﬁlm transmission especially in the near infrared (NIR) region reduces as a result of absorption by free carriers or by metal-like reﬂection. It is therefore, important that further reductions in the TCO resistivity must not adversely reduce the optical transparency of the ﬁlm. However ρ of a TCO ﬁlm may be decreased without reducing the NIR transmission by increasing µ rather than N. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of absorptance in a material with a ﬁxed carrier density (5×1020cm−3) as the mobility increases [8]. Since TCO ﬁlms useful for most applications must have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) which requires a degenerate carrier density ≥10 20cm−3 and ideallyρ<10−3Ωcm, using Eq. (1), the corresponding Hall mobility would be µ≥62.5 cm2V−1s−1. Therefore, in this contribution, high mobility transparent conducting oxides (HMTCO) are used to refer to TCO ﬁlms which fulﬁll the above conditions and have a value of mobility ≥62.5cm2V−1s−1. Ti- and Mo-doped In2O3 (in short, ITiO and IMO respectively) are examples of TCO materials possessing high mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with high NIR transparency while maintaining low ρ~10−4Ωcm. Fig. 2 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra of several thin ﬁlms composed of ITiO, IMO, In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO). The ITiO and IMO ﬁlms were prepared by magnetron sputtering in research laboratory conditions while the ITO and FTO ﬁlms were obtained from commercial vendors, for details refer to a previous study in [9]. The sheet resistance of the ﬁlms ranges from 6 Ω/□to 11 Ω/□and the indium based ﬁlms have a comparable resistivity ρ<2×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is slightly higher at 3.9×10−4Ωcm. While the transmission of the ITO ﬁlm begins to dip at around 950 nm, that of the IMO and ITiO ﬁlms remains high and begins to dip for wavelengths >1200 nm. Though the NIR optical loses may be further reduced by reducing N, doing so indiscriminately can decrease the conductivity and/or the optical band gap of the TCO layer and adversely affect the electrical properties and transparency in the visible wavelength region. Therefore, TCO materials with sufﬁciently high N (≥1020cm−3) while maintaining a high mobility and transparency are desirable. High mobility TCO materials have been prepared in the past but the resistivity has been greater than 10−3Ωcm because of a relatively lowN<10 19cm−3 [10,11]. Such low carrier density levels would require a Hall mobility in the excess of 400 cm2V−1s−1 to achieve ρ<10−4Ω cm. CdO is a well known material with mobility as high as µ = 146 cm2 V−1 s−1 with N=1.5×1020cm−3 [12] but is not suitable for most TCO applications because of absorptioninthe visible light spectrum as a result of a low band gap <3.0 eV and environmental issues. High mobility TCO ﬁlms with a sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and an optical transmission of ≥80% over the visible to NIR wavelengths are potentially useful to enhance solar cell efﬁciency. This is particularly useful in the case of multi-junction solar cells, consisting of stacks of different semiconductors with appropriately matched band gaps to increase the spectral response over a wide wavelength range. Ideally, the bottommost cell should receive photons that are unused by the upper absorbers and thus transmitted through the upper cells including their TCO contacts. Fig. 3 shows a graph comparing the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of single junction solar cells based on absorbers with different optical band gaps and using conventional TCO materials such as ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn as transparent contacts. The EQE curve of the gallium rich CuIn1 −XGaXSe2 (CIGS) cell, labelled C, in Fig. 3 is unexpectedly low for energies above the theoretical band gap because of poor current collection as a result of recombination [13]. Otherwise, for all the solar cells, a signiﬁcant portion of the loss in EQE is caused by optical losses in the front contact TCO. If such solar cell structures are used in a multi-junction device, the amount of light reaching the bottom absorber (with the lowest band gap) is severely reduced causing a current mismatch [14]. When comparing the EQE of the CIS absorber represented by curve A in Fig. 3 with the TCO transmission spectra presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that improvements in the EQE, especially for wavelengths greater than 900 nm are possible if HMTCO contacts are used. Thus, HMTCO ﬁlms could potentially improve the efﬁciency of such solar cells by reducing the optical losses while minimising resistive losses. In this article strategies used to improve the carrier mobility in degenerately doped TCO thin ﬁlms are reviewed. A survey of dopant elements known to improve the mobility of In2O3 and CdO is presented. A discussion aimed at understanding the reasons for high mobility in these materials is given. Examples of the application of HMTCO ﬁlms in solar cells are described and used to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of improved NIR transmission to these devices. Finally, challenges and prospects for further development of HMTCO materials are discussed. 2. Strategies to attain high mobility in TCO materials Various strategies have been employed to increase the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms while maintaining high transparency and conductivity as reviewed by Exarhos and Zhou [15]. Traditionally, the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms has been enhanced by improving the crystalline structure by means such as heat treatment, choice of deposition technique as well as choice of substrate. Here, we expand on some of those strategies and include several other methods that are perhaps less well known, but seem promising. 2.1. Post deposition heat treatment TCO thin ﬁlms prepared without intentional substrate heating or with low process temperatures exhibit low electron mobility as a result of scattering by grain boundaries and/or point defects. Post deposition heat treatment in different ambient conditions reduces point and/or dislocation defects in the amorphous or poorly crystallised TCO ﬁlms by increasing the grain size and improving the overall crystal structure enhancing the electron mobility [3,16]. However, effective heat treatment may require temperatures approaching 1840 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 600 °C, that are unsuitable for heat sensitive substrates such as polymers or even soda lime glass which may soften and introduce undesirable impurities in the TCO ﬁlms and thus other methods have to be used. 2.2. Choice of deposition method While ﬁlm growth by highly energetic particles may increase the grain size of TCO ﬁlms, an excessive transfer of momentum may damage the ﬁlms and reduce the mobility [16]. During sputtering, the discharge voltage at the target surface repels both negative oxygen ions and neutral argon atoms, which arrive at the substrate with high kinetic energy of ~100 eV and distort the TCO crystalline structure [17]. Since the discharge voltage is less for RF sputtering than for DC sputtering, it is usual for TCO ﬁlms grown by the former method to have higher values of mobility [17,18]. The kinetic energy of particles related to pulsed laser deposition varies from 1 eV to a few 100 eV but is easier to control than in sputtering resulting in better TCO crystalline structures leading to higher mobility [19]. 2.3. Control of crystal structure using mono-crystalline substrates Control of crystal growth by using highly oriented substrates is known to enhance the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms by improving crystallinity. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) is often used to grow low resistivity ITO thin ﬁlms [20]. Though the ITO crystal quality can be improved the increase in the mobility is not drastic compared to ITO prepared on glass. Therefore, other factors such as the character of the doping ions may play a role in determining the charge carrier mobility. However, the highest reported mobility for highly conductive ZnO: Al~70 cm2V−1s−1 at N>1020cm−3 has been reported for ﬁlms grown on c-plane sapphire [19]. A study of Cd2SnO4 ﬁlms grown on different substrate illustrates this point further where the mobility of the ﬁlms was measured as 609 cm2V−1s−1 (the highest reported value for a degenerate TCO material), 330 cm2V−1s−1 and 27 cm2V−1s−1 using MgO(111), MgO(100) and boro-silicate glass substrates, respectively [21]. The relatively high cost and limited suitability of these highly oriented substrates on large areas precludes the use of epitaxially grown TCO in a wide range of applications, especially displays and solar cells. 2.4. Controlling impurity concentration Hall mobility in TCO thin ﬁlms can be increased by reducing scattering caused by intrinsic crystalline defects and/or ionised impurities. A relatively high mobility in ZnO:Al up to 44.2 cm2V−1s−1 with N=3.8×1020cm−3 was achieved using a ZnO target with a low Al2O3 concentration of 0.5wt.% [22]. By minimising intrinsic defects in thin ﬁlm ZnO, a mobility of 440 cm2V−1s−1 but with a low N of<1016 cm−3 could be achieved [11]. 2.5. Selective doping methods Selective doping methods may increase the relaxation time in TCO materials by separating the doping and charge transport regions. In such cases, the charge carriers are provided by the heavily doped regions while the lightly doped regions provide a high mobility path where scattering by ionised or neutral impurities, is minimised. Zone conﬁning is achieved by applying a (quasi) periodic temperature gradient across the surface of the substrate during deposition of the TCO material [23]. Fig. 3.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 During ﬁlm growth, the impurities tend to accumulate in the colder areas of the substrate surface. The impurity movement and temperature gradient are mutually parallel and are perpendicular to the growth direction. The result is a ﬁlm consisting of alternate zones of heavily doped metal oxide and almost pure metal oxide (see Fig. 4a). Using this method, a high mobility of 103 cm2V−1s−1 and an average carrier density of 1.4×1021cm−3 give a resistivity of 4.4×10−5Ω cm for ITO [23,24]. However, the visible transparency of ITO prepared using this method including the substrate, was below 80% [24]. Selective doping using multi-layered ﬁlms composed of lightly and heavily doped semiconductors alternately stacked in the direction of the ﬁlm growth (see Fig. 4b), is also referred to as modulation doping [25]. Several studies predict that modulation doping may improve TCO mobility [26,27]. Simulations on multi-layered ﬁlms composed of InGaO3 (relatively large electron afﬁnity and low carrier density) alternately stacked with ZnO:Al layers (low electron afﬁnity and high carrier density) have predicted that high conductivity >4.2×104S cm−1 for carrier densities ~1020cm−3 are possible [26]. Simulations of the transport mechanisms revealed that the conductivity is very sensitive to the quantum well thickness. The authors proposed that high mobilities derived from doping modulation would require individual layers of <5 nm thick and high crystal quality materials with close lattice matching in order to avoid interface defects which would be challenging to achieve in practice [26]. A mobility of 1560 cm V−1s−1 is possible if N=1×1020cm−3 at the bottom of a 5 nm wide quantum well giving a resistivity of 4.0×10−5Ω cm. A similar simulation was performed for modulation-doped multi-layers composed of ZnO|ZnMgO|ZnMgO:Al| ZnMgO all of which are closely lattice matched [26]. Mobilities as high as 145 cm2V−1s−1 were predicted for a structure with an average carrier density of 3.8×1018cm−3 but the lowest resistivity was limited to 1.5×10−3Ω cm. Multi-layers consisting of ZnO|ZnO:Al and ZnO|Zn1−X MgXO:Al have also been prepared on a- and c-plane sapphire substrates and though the crystal structure was comparable to that of single layers, the resistivity was quite high [28]. The authors attributed this effect to the high oxidation sensitivity of the thin ﬁlms which passivated the donors and reduced the carrier density. Also, multi-layered ﬁlms consisting of the dopant oxide ﬁlms alternating with the host cation oxide have been prepared, i.e. InOX (2.0 nm)|SnOY (0.2 nm) obtaining a relatively low mobility of 17 cm2V−1s−1 and a carrier density of 5×1020cm−3 [29]. To date, the predicted high mobility cannot be obtained in thin ﬁlms prepared by modulation doping as desired for most TCO applications such as photovoltaic cells. 2.6. Hydrogen inclusion Total energy calculations based on ﬁrst principles suggest that the bond length between hydrogen and the nearest host oxygen atom in a metal oxide is virtually the same regardless of the metal [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen is “pinned” at a ﬁxed energy level which introduces shallow defect states inside the conduction band of oxides with a high electron afﬁnity leading to n-type doping. It has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates structural defects in TCO materials in the same way as is well known for thin ﬁlm silicon [31,32]. Hydrogen inclusion in TCO materials is achieved either during ﬁlm deposition or by post deposition annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. One of the highest mobilities for ITO (μ~145 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been achieved by post deposition treatment in a hydrogen plasma [32] while that for ZnO:Al (μ~50 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been reported for ﬁlms sputtered with a small amount of hydrogen added to the sputter gas [33]. A high value of µ=130 cm2V−1s−1 for N=1.8×1020cm−3 has also been reported for hydrogen doped In2O3 [32]. 2.7. Choice of appropriate dopants The highest mobilities achieved for conventional degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering are typically 40–50 cm2V−1s−1 for ITO [16,34,35] and ZnO:Al [7,17]. However, speciﬁc elements have been used to prepare degenerate CdO and In2O3 thin ﬁlms by sputtering with µ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with transmission of >80% in the visible and near infra-red wavelength regions. While undoped CdO thin ﬁlms have a high mobility, the optical band gap is too low for use as a transparent conductor for visible light. However, doping cadmium oxide with several elements e.g. In [12], Sc [36], Y [37] and Ti [38] can lead to mobilities above 62.5 cm2V−1s−1 while maintaining N≥1020cm−3. A wider range of doping elements has been used to achieve high mobility in In2O3 thin ﬁlms such as Mo [39–41], Ti [42–47], W [48–51], Zr [42,43,52–55], and Gd [56]. Details of dopants elements leading to high mobility in CdO and In2O3 are presented later in Section 4.3. 3. Deposition methods for degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms with mobility higher than 62 cm2V−1s−1 Impurity doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms with high mobility can be prepared using a variety of methods as listed in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that though high mobility in impurity doped In2O3 can be achieved by a wide range of deposition techniques, the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and/or post deposition annealing further enhances the Hall mobility. The lowest resistivity reported for IMO thin ﬁlms to date is 6.7×10−5Ω cm with a high mobility (250cm2V−1s−1) grown at 500 °C byPLD onquartz[41]. However, the NIR opticaltransmissionis not known as a high transmittance (~90%) was only presented for visible light. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of high mobility in impurity doped CdO and In2O3 The mobility µ of an electron in semiconductors depends on the relaxation time τ, the electronic charge e and the effective carrier mass m* in the conduction band as given by the following relationship μ = eτ m* : ð2Þ Therefore, the mobility can be increased by increasing τ or by decreasing m*. Increasing τ requires ﬁlms with fewer defects which may be achieved by lower carrier density, less grain boundaries and less neutral impurities. Decreasing m*, requires semiconductors with a widely dispersed conduction band. The scattering mechanisms that govern the electron transport in semiconductors are described in detail in text books such as that by Lundstrom [64]. Of these, the scattering mechanisms relevant to ntype TCO thin ﬁlms have been identiﬁed by other authors [3,65–67]. Brieﬂy, they are: i. Grain boundary scattering caused by the discontinuity presented by grain boundaries especially in polycrystalline thin ﬁlm Fig. 4. Schematic showing charge carrier distributions in relation to the direction of ﬁlm growth of semiconductors prepared using selective doping by zone conﬁning (a) and modulation (b). The dark and light sections denote regions of high and low carrier density, respectively. 1842 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 materials. A space charge region formed around the grain boundaries and the resulting potential barrier scatters the electrons crossing this region reducing the mobility. Grain boundary scattering only signiﬁcantly affects the overall TCO mobility if the grain size is about the same as the mean free path of the charge carriers. ii. Ionised impurity scattering caused by deﬂection of free carriers by the long-range electrostatic ﬁelds associated with intentional dopants and defects such as interstitials and vacancies. iii. Optical phonon scattering caused by lattice vibrations of bonds in a polar semiconductor which induce an electric ﬁeld that interacts with a charge moving through the lattice. iv. Acoustic-phonon scattering caused by an acoustic wave propagation through a crystal lattice which causes the atoms to oscillate about their equilibrium positions and interfere with the electron motion. v. Neutral impurity scattering caused by non-ionised impurities. vi. Piezoelectric scattering which arises from electric ﬁelds caused by the strain associated with lattice vibrations in crystals where partially ionic bonds occur such that the unit cell does not contain a centre of symmetry. Matthiesen's rule states that the contribution of different scattering processes to the mobility and thus carrier transport is additive provided that the scattering mechanisms are independent [64]. Therefore for the above scattering processes, the overall mobility is given by the following relation. 1 μ = ∑ n i=1 1 μi ð3Þ where µi is the mobility due to the ith scattering mechanism. In practice, the conductivity of TCO materials cannot be increased by simultaneously increasing the carrier density and the mobility. Usually, the mobility is observed to saturate and even start to reduce as the carrier density is increased indicating dominant scattering by ionised impurities. Normally, grain boundary scattering is dominant for N≤1019cm−3 while charge impurity scattering is more signiﬁcant for N≥1019cm−3 for ITO and ZnO:Al [1,28,34,66,68]. Recent studies also suggest that for N>1019cm−3, the nature of the scattering differs for both ITO and ZnO:Al as a result of the piezoelectricity of the latter material leading to higher trap densities [66]. 4.1. Role of crystalline quality and structure Poor crystalline quality may cause a reduction in the relaxation time and thus mobility as a result of increased point defects, grain boundaries and lattice distortion. Electron transport in n-type semiconductor is facilitated by the vacant s-orbitals of neighbouring cations in the crystal lattice overlapping to form a conduction path. Moreover, if the crystal structure is disrupted by say, a cation vacancy, the spatial spread of the vacant s-orbital around that site is disrupted causing the effective mass of the electron to increase thus reducing its mobility. Therefore, shorter cation–cation bond length and a favourable distribution of the cations are believed to increase the mobility of the electrons in the semiconductor. Early work by Shannon [69] on single crystals in the CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family revealed that oxide structures with continuous edge sharing of cation octahedra are essential for conductivity in metal oxides. Later work by Ingram et al. [70] on thin ﬁlms of the same CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family extended this rule to include structures where octahedra share corners. They also classiﬁed TCO materials according to the coordination of the cations e.g. ZnO has tetrahedral coordination, while CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and other Cd containing spinel oxides have octahedral coordination. The decrease in both conductivity and mobility was also correlated to a decrease in the octahedral cation density in the structure in the order: CdO (rock salt)>In2O3 (bixbyite)>SnO2 (rutile) [70]. Studies of ZnSnO4 by Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that the unusually low mobility is a result of disorder on the cation octahedral sites which may disrupt transport between edge sharing cations [71]. Therefore, since high mobility with degenerate doping has only been reported for CdO and In2O3 based compounds with octahedrally coordinated cations, the associated cubic structure may also favour high mobility. 4.2. Role of the electronic band structure The electronic band structure of TCO materials can be studied by theoretical modelling or by measurements of the relaxation time and effective mass as well as the Hall parameters. Owing to the simple structure of CdO, the majority of theoretical electronic band structure studies have been done on this material. Freeman et al. [72,73] have identiﬁed three salient features of the electronic band structure of the conduction band of a TCO material which affect the charge carrier transport mechanisms namely, the curvature, the dispersion and the position. A parabolic conduction band minimum ensures a low effective carrier mass of the electrons which promotes high mobility. A study of the Cd1+XIn2−2XSnXO4 system shows that both the density of states effective mass and the relaxation time increase with N resulting in a cancellation effect such that the mobility is less than expected [74].

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 contrast, the effective carrier mass of IMO was determined as 0.32me and found to be independent of N implying a parabolic conduction band minimum[58].A widely dispersed conduction band minimum allows the drift of electrons unimpeded through the crystal structure resulting in a higher relaxation time and thus higher mobility. Electronic band structure calculations of InXCd1−XO thin ﬁlms for which mobility up to 91.5 cm2V−1s−1 withN>1020cm−3 was measured, revealed an electron effective mass of 0.24–0.26me and a broadening of the conduction band edge by hybridization of the Cd 5s and In 5s bands [12]. The calculated effective electron mass agrees with a value of 0.25me determined by Seebeck measurements [75]. Theoretical studies also suggest that the lowest conduction band of In2O3 is split with Sn doping due to the strong hybridization with dopant s-type states and this splitting contributes to both the decrease of the plasma frequency and the mobility of the carriers [73]. In contrast, calculations of the IMO electronic band structure suggest that high mobility is achievable in degenerate In2O3:Mo as the d-states of Mo do not hybridize with the s-states of In resulting in m* similar to undoped In2O3 [76]. 4.3. Chemical character of impurity dopant element From the descriptions given above, it can be seen that the choice of elements that induce high mobility in TCO materials has largely been empirical. Few if any studies have been conducted to ﬁnd the underlying mechanisms for high mobility caused by speciﬁc dopants. A series of studies predicted that the mobility of doped In2O3 would increase with the Lewis acid strength of the doping element and reported this effect for Ge4+, Si4+ and Sn4+ [77] as well as for Cu, Ti and Zr [78]. However, the µ of the TCO ﬁlms studied generally ranged from 45 cm2V−1s−1 to 55 cm2V−1s−1 and in some cases, the ﬁlms were non-degenerate. In this contribution, we shall attempt to apply the same principles to known degenerately doped In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms with mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1. The Lewis acid strength L can be calculated using a formula developed by Zhang [79] as follows L = Z r2 −7:7χz + 0:8 ð4Þ where r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force due to the oxidation state Z of the ion and χz is the electronegativity of the element in the respective oxidation state. Using this formula, the Lewis acid strengths of elements that are now known to induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms were compiled in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All these ﬁlms presented are highly transparent in the visible and most (where reported) have a high near infra-red region transmission. Generally, it can be seen that the dopants which induce higher mobilities are transition elements which have a higher Lewis acid strength than the host cation. The lists in Tables 2 and 3 are not exhaustive and have been compiled, where possible, from TCO ﬁlms prepared by MOCVD or sputtering, respectively, on glass substrates to reduce the inﬂuence of the ﬁlm deposition technique on the mobility values reported. Also, these ﬁlms may not represent the highest possible mobility achieved by a given dopant. However, most of the dopants listed that induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO are strong Lewis acids compared to Cd2+ and In3+, respectively. There are two exceptions in Table 2, namely H+ and Gd3+. The Lewis acid strength for H+ has not been calculated because of the difﬁculty in determining the ionic radius which is anyway expected to be much less than that of In3+. As mentioned previously, H+ is a shallow donor in most TCO ﬁlms with a high electron afﬁnity, hydrogen may also passivate defect states in In2O3 thus increasing theτ and improving µ [32]. However, the optical properties of H-doped In2O3 have not yet been reported. On the other hand, Gd3+ has a much higher ionic radius and a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ but corresponds to a high mobility of 128 cm2V−1s−1. Gadolinium belongs to a special group of metals known as Lanthanoids, most of which have a partially ﬁled 4f orbital, lying below group three transition metals in the periodic table and hence may warrant further investigation [80]. While doping CdO by Sn4+ and In3+ leads to µ~70 cm2V−1s−1, doping using Y3+ and Ti4+ both transition metal ions results in a drastic increase inµ. We note here that the highest mobility for CdO based material has been observed for a Cd1−XSnXO layer grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgO single crystals, as 609 cm2V−1s−1 and N=4.74×1020cm−3. Sn4+ beinga non-transition metal ion with a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ will induce a lower mobility in In2O3 than the transition elements listed in Table 2. On the other hand, mobility values of <62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with N>1020cm−3 have been reported for nontransition metal dopants with high enough Lewis acid strengths such as Sb5+ (3.559), Ge4+(3.059) and Si4+ (8.098) [77]. According to Wen et al. [77], the high Lewis acid dopants polarise the electronic charge away from the O2−2p valence band more strongly than weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering centre hence increasing the mobility. Similarly, the reason for higher mobility in IMO compared to intrinsic In2O3 has been explained by Mo suppressing scattering by oxygen interstitials [58]. However, if the Lewis acid is too strong e.g. Ge in In2O3, the dopant has a greater afﬁnity to oxygen and may incorporate an excess of oxygen in the lattice which would then limit the µ by the introduction of scattering centres [77]. Originally, the high mobility of IMO was attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+ ions that would contribute three extra electrons to the In2O3 matrix [57]. Later studies by another group suggested that Mo in IMO exists as both Mo4+ and Mo6+ for high carrier density and only as Mo6+ for ﬁlms with lower carrier density [85]. However, since other Table 2 High mobility dopants in In2O3 thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering on glass substrates except where indicated.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 transition elements with a lower oxidation state such as Ti and Zr, etc showhighmobility, ahighoxidationstate isnotnecessarily aconditionfor high mobility. The charge carrier mobility and the visible light transparency of Ti-, Zr-, and Ge-doped In2O3 are much higher than that of ITO for the same dopant atomic concentration [78]. A similar comparison of In2O3 doped by Sn, Ti and Zr, all of which, can have a oxidation state +4 showed that the electron mobility and the NIR transmission were highest for the transition metal dopants [55]. Though the role of possible multiple valency e.g. of Ti as Ti2+ was not considered, these studies asserted that high mobility in In2O3 at least is only exhibited for transition metal dopants. 5. Application of high mobility TCO thin ﬁlms in solar cells At the front of a solar cell, the TCO layer acts as an electrical contact as well as a window to allow light through to the PV absorber layer. At the back of the cell, the TCO usually acts as an interfacial layer to improve the contact resistance between the PV absorber and a metallic reﬂector and also as an optical coupling layer by improving the refractive index matching. In bifacial solar cells, the back contact must act both as an electrical contact and as a window layer to let light through the back of the PV absorber layer. Since high photoconversion efﬁciency in solar cells requires minimal optical and electrical losses, a TCO layer with sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and transparency of >80% over the wavelength spectrum useable by the solar cell is mandatory. High mobility TCO materials are especially desirable where a high transparency of >80% is required over a wide spectral range (400–1300 nm) such as in micro-crystalline silicon, CIGS and other multi-junction solar cells. 5.1. Single junction solar cells High mobility TCO layers can be used as front contact for single junction solar cells in the superstrate conﬁguration because the highest possible process temperatures can be used to optimise the resistivity and transparency. A record efﬁciency of 16.5% for CdTe solar cells has been achieved using CdSnO4 coated glass in the superstrate conﬁguration [86]. Also, an improved light trapping structure for nano-crystalline silicon solar cells using In2O3:Mo layers with a textured ZnO layer can increase the QE for wavelengths exceeding 900 nm compared to cells using ZnO:Al [87]. On the other hand, using In2O3:Ti, a relatively low efﬁciency of 10.7% (compared to state of the art efﬁciency ~20%) has been obtained for CIGS solar cells in the substrate conﬁguration (glass|Mo|CIGS|ZnO|ITiO) [88]. The reason for this low efﬁciency is the high series resistance of the cell caused by high resistivity of the ITiO, since the processing of ITiO could not be done at high temperatures, a problem encountered for all other high mobility TCO ﬁlms as discussed later. 5.2. Bifacial solar cells Bifacial CIGS thin ﬁlm solar cells have been prepared on ITiO coated substrates with improved efﬁciency under rear side illumination as a result of reduced NIR light absorption [89]. However, again here, since the back contact must be highly conductive, a means of processing the HMTCO at low temperature with reasonable conductivity must be developed to realise the full potential of bifacial cells. 5.3. Multi-junction solar cells The top and intermediate solar cells in a multi-junction conﬁguration require a transparent conducting contact at both the front and back of the cell to ensure efﬁcient transmission of unused light to the underlying lower band gap solar cell. CdTe with an optical band gap ~1.45 eV and amorphous silicon ~1.7 eV are examples of solid state absorber materials suitable for upper junctions in multi-junction solar cells. Also, dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) whose spectral response can be adjusted by varying the TiO2 nano-particle size or the sensitising dye, are promising candidates for the top junction in a multi-junction solar cells. CdTe solar cells with a signiﬁcantly high efﬁciency of 13.9% have been developed on Cd2SnO4 coated glass (µ~53.2 cm2V−1s−1, resistivity ρ~1.8×10−4Ω cm) while maintaining a NIR transparency of 50% for the entire device [90]. While a high efﬁciency of the top solar cell is desirable, its full impact on the entire multi-junction solar cell efﬁciency cannot be realised unless the NIR transparency is improved to ensure adequate current matching with the bottom cells [14]. Improvements in NIR transparency through a TCO|CdTe|TCO device structure to values above 60%, require the use of a HMTCO e.g. Mo- or Ti-doped In2O3, at both the front and back sides of the solar cell to reduce parasitic absorption and reﬂection losses [9]. Fig. 5 shows the NIR transmission spectra of identical CdTe solar cells using all IMO or all ITO contacts. There is a signiﬁcant gain in NIR transmission when using IMO contacts for a CdTe solar cell that would act as either a top or an intermediate absorber in a multi-junction solar cell. Such a stack requires that the rear side TCO, which has to be prepared at low temperatures over the absorber layers, is sufﬁciently conductive to prevent losses in the total cell voltage and ﬁll factor which would limit the overall photo-conversion cell efﬁciency. However, high mobility TCOs have been used to improve the total current of a tandem solar cell consisting of an Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell [91]. On the other hand, the TCO layers applied at both the front and rear of a dye sensitised solar cell, can be prepared using high process temperatures without the danger of destroying the mesoscopic TiO2 layers. Taking advantage of this fact, semi-transparent dye sensitised solar cells were prepared using ITiO coated glass for possible application in tandem solar cells [92]. While the NIR transparency increased to 60% compared to DSC devices using FTO coated glass, the efﬁciency was somewhat lower i.e. 5.8% compared to 8.2%, respectively [92]. The reason for the lower efﬁciency was the different growth conditions of the TiO2 interfacial layer on the smoother ITiO ﬁlms (compared to FTO) and on the elevated resistivity of the ITiO after a sintering step at 450 °C in air required to prepare the porous TiO2 absorber. A slight improvement in the DSC efﬁciency to 6.8% could be achieved by adjusting the growth conditions of the dense TiO2 interfacial layer and by heating the entire stack in vacuum after the sintering step in air [93]. The improvement occurred primarily because of increased ﬁll factor resulting from a lower series resistance due to lower resistivity ITiO layers. Heating the ITiO layer in vacuum, desorbs loosely bound oxygen at the surface creating Fig. 5.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 vacancies and oxygen residing along grain boundaries (if the TCO is slightly porous) thus lowering the depletion barrier along the grain boundaries, increasing the charge carrier density while improving the electron mobility, respectively. This “conduction recovery” phenomenon is used for gas sensor application and was reported in 1977 for CdIn2O4 [69] and in the early 1980s for SnO2 [94] and In2O3 [95]. 6. Challenges and prospects In 1999, Coutts et al. [96] outlined key areas of basic research to improve the opto-electronic properties of TCO thin ﬁlms focusing on the development of improved materials which can be easily applied on an industrial scale. While the HMTCO materials reviewed in this article can be prepared with µ of >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 using sputtering and MOCVD which are well developed deposition techniques for industrial fabrication, some challenges still remain. 6.1. Low mobility in TCO ﬁlms prepared with low processing temperature It is desirable to prepare thin ﬁlms at low temperatures to coat plastic substrates or pre-deposited layers of an opto-electronic device with minimal damage, to reduce the energy input into the manufacturing process and to avoid diffusion of undesirable impurities from the substrate into the TCO ﬁlms. We note here that all the low resistivity TCO materials with μ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 in Tables 2 and 3 were prepared with deposition temperatures of at least 300 °C. The typical evolution of the ρ, N and µ values of IMO thin ﬁlms with increasing heater temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The substrate temperature in this case is not more than 10% lower than the heater temperature. These ﬁlms were prepared by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering from a ceramic In2O3:Mo (98:2 wt%) target using argon containing 0.53 vol.% of oxygen at a sputter pressure of 1.0 Pa, with further details reported elsewhere [97]. The resistivity generally reduces as the heater temperature TH increases from 25 °C to 450 °C then saturates at about 2.0×10−4Ω cm at 450 °C and 500 °C. The decrease in resistivity is caused by a concurrent increase in N and µ from 0.6×1020cm−3 to 4.5×1020cm−3 and from 9 cm2V−1s−1 to 73 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Theobservedsuppressionofmobilitytovaluesbelow62.5 cm V−1s−1 at low process temperature of >300 °C, has also been observed by other groups for In2O3:Mo [39,43,45,47,85], In2O3:Ti [45], In2O3:Zr and In2O3: Wo [49]. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for IMO ﬁlms preparedwithoutintentional substrateheatingandwith heatingto500 °C which are described in depth elsewhere [97]. In both cases, the molybdenum exists in the oxidation states of +6 and +4 as well as an intermediate oxidation state +4<x<+6 [98,99]. The ﬁlms grown on heated substrates also contain a small amount of elemental Mo. Though the Mo6+ state is prevalent in both ﬁlms, the Mox+ species are much higher in the low temperature ﬁlm. These Mox+ species are associated withhydroxyls andothercomplex oxides,suchas Mo4O11[99] which may exist as neutral impurities in the ﬁlm and thus reduce the mobility by scattering as has also been reported for In2O3:Sn ﬁlms [34,100]. Additionally, the carrier density of the ﬁlms increases as expected from theory as the Mo6+ species exceeds the sum of the remaining Mo species in the ﬁlm. While this result agrees with some authors [57], other [85] report that the Mo4+ species rather than the Mo6+ contribute to the conduction electrons in IMO. However, both the maximum values of carrier density ~2×1020cm−3 and mobility 44 cm V−1s−1 reported in [85] are less than the corresponding values of 4×1020cm−3 and 73 cm V−1s−1 presented in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, in both cases, the dopant efﬁciency was lower than 100% indicating that some of the charge carriers could be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Table 4 lists the electrical and optical characteristics of IMO, IWO, and ITiO thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating. It can be seen that regardless of the deposition technique, the IMO ﬁlms have μ<25 cm2V−1s−1 which is slightly less than the value reported for degenerate ﬁlms of ITO [101,102] and ZnO:Al [17,103] and much less than that for intrinsic In2O3 [82,104], all deposited without intentional substrate heating. A similar problem is experienced for ﬁlms prepared using the other transition elements as dopants for In2O3 as listed in Table 4. The cause for low µ for ﬁlms prepared at low deposition temperatures is not yet fully understood. This is a major Fig. 6. Resistivity ρ (triangles), Hall mobility µ (circles) and charge carrier density N (squares) of IMO thin ﬁlms as a function of heater temperature. The lines are to guide the eye. Fig. 7. Mo 3d spectra for In2O3:Mo ﬁlms prepared without intentional heating (25°) and with a heater temperature of 500 °C. 1846 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 challenge that precludes the preparation of these high mobility ﬁlms onto heat sensitive substrates. An interesting development is a signiﬁcantly high mobility between 50cm2V−1s−1 and 60cm2V−1s−1 that can be obtained in degenerate amorphous Zn-doped In2O3 ﬁlms prepared without substrate heating [111,112]. These ﬁlms have a relatively high optical transmission in the NIR wavelength region and thus may be an alternative to high mobility TCO materials for coating heat sensitive substrates. It has been proposed that since oxygen vacancies contribute signiﬁcantly to the conductivity of the IZO thin ﬁlms, Zn2+ substitution on In3+ sites does not decrease the carrier density of In2O3 ﬁlms and thus a degenerate carrier density is maintained [104,111]. Further, Zn may increase the density of oxygen vacancies by reducing some of the In–O bonds [104] or by passivating defects caused by interstitial oxygen. The results of the studies mentioned above indicate that the electronic band structure rather than crystalline structure determines the maximum attainable high mobility in TCO materials. 6.2. Inadequate characterisation and analysis methods One of the major problems in studying the limitations of mobility in TCO ﬁlms is the difﬁculty in obtaining sufﬁciently accurate values of effective mass and relaxation times which are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms. Data extracted from optical analysis using Drude's model and the Burstein–Moss shift has to be treated with caution because of the difﬁculties in measuring the ﬁlm thickness to a high enough accuracy and assumptions that the conduction band is parabolic, respectively [8,113]. Young et al. [114] described a four coefﬁcient method used to measure the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients of TCO thin ﬁlms which can be used to determine the charge carrier density, mobility, the effective electron mass, the scattering mechanisms and relaxation time. However, though Hall measurements are widely used, experimental determination of the Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients for these high mobility TCO materials is rarely done, and hence the exact scattering mechanisms limiting the mobility can only be estimated or speculated. Studies on the electronic transport mechanisms reported for HMTCO ﬁlms so far seem to be empirical. Theoretical modelling using either computational chemistry or physics methods is a useful tool for calculating and understanding the structure and properties of materials and may even predict hitherto unknown materials with desirable transparent conducting properties. In particular, more insights into the inﬂuence of dopant chemistry, dopant concentration, and ﬁlm structure on the charge carrier transport mechanisms would aid improvements in the resistivity exhibited by these high mobility TCO materials. Developments in electronic band structure calculations may aid in predicting the material behaviour and can help to elucidate limitations to mobility and doping efﬁciency. For example, a combination of electronic band structure calculations and Seebeck measurements has been used to determine an electron effective mass of Cd2SnO4 around 0.25me [12,75] which is much higher than values of 0.08–0.11me and 0.04me, determined from the Burstein–Moss shift in the 1970s by Nozik [10] and Haacke [115], respectively. However, most of the reported theoretical electronic band structure calculations for HMTCO have focused onCdO ratherthanIn2O3,possiblybecauseofthesimplicityof theformer's rock salt structure. However since In2O3 is less hazardous material and thus more technologically important, more theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure and properties of this material are required to advance the development of TCO materials with improved conductivity. 6.3. Lack of alternative low cost and environmentally benign materials The high mobility with low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm values described in the previous sections have only been observed inmaterials based on In2O3 whichisrathercostlyandCdOwhichispotentiallyhazardousandmaynot be acceptable for environmental reasons. Efforts to dope cheaper and environmentally benign materials with transition elements have not yet resulted in higher mobility e.g. ZnO doped with Zr [116], Ti [117], Mo [33], Ta doped SnO2 [118] and Nb-doped TiO2 [119]. Also, doping ZnO with hydrogen [120] gives a mobility of ~40 cm2V−1s−1 which is comparable withvaluesforAldopingandmuchlessthanthevalueof130 cm2V−1s−1 forH-doped In2O3[32]. Itispossiblethat the wurzite structure of ZnO with tetrahedral coordination is less favourable for electron transport than the cubic structure of CdO and In2O3 both of which have an octahedral coordination [70]. In general, for the same dopant element e.g. tin, the mobility of the ﬁlms increases going from ZnO to In2O3 to CdO as Sn inclusion in ZnO causes disorder in the octahedral causing short relaxation times despite the low effective electron mass [71]. Evidently, to achieve high mobility but cheap and non-hazardous TCO materials, alternative dopants or ternary compounds of ZnO, SnO2 and possibly TiO2, need to be developed and alternative materials that may not necessarily be oxides should be investigated. Single walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNT) are an emerging p-type transparent conducting material that has low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm with transparency of >80% over the visible and near infrared wavelength regions [121]. Promising solar cell efﬁciencies have been achieved on CIGS [122] and on CdTe [123] using SWNT as transparent contacts. Improvements in SWNT for application in PV should be aimed at reducing the relatively high visible light absorption in ﬁlms thicker than 100 nm [121–123]. 6.4. High resistivity despite higher mobility Lastly, despite the elevated values of mobility reported, the resistivity of the In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms has remained similar to that of state of the art ITO thin ﬁlms. A lower than expected dopant activation as well as an upper limit for carrier density above which the mobility begins to reduce has been reported for In2O3:Mo [58,85,124,125], In2O3:W [48,63], In2O3:Zr [52,54] and In2O3:Ti Table 4 A survey of transition element doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating.

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 [44,45]. For the case of In2O3:Mo, it is possible that the reduced dopant activation efﬁciency of Mo is caused by interstitial oxygen forming neutral complexes with some of the Mo at speciﬁc substitutional sites as inferred by some authors [124] and as demonstrated by the XPS measurements discussed in Section 6.1 of this article. Examination of heavily W-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms by Energy-Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed segregation of tungsten at the grain boundaries where it is ineffective as a donor [63]. This implies that the transition element dopants limit the mobility through formation of neutral and impurity scattering centres in much the same way as observed for In2O3:Sn [34,126]. Theoretical modelling and electronic bandstructure calculationsmay beused tounderstand thelimitations to the conductivity of HMTCO ﬁlms and to predict other eligible dopants. However, for accurate and realistic results, the required calculation time as well as the hardware resources increases with the complexity of the host oxides (especially In2O3) and the (transition metal) dopant ions making accurate theoretical calculations difﬁcult. 7. Summary The literature reviewed in this contribution shows that previously stated limits for mobility in low resistivity TCO ﬁlms have been exceeded. Several high mobility TCO materials based on In2O3 and CdO that combine low resistivity with a high visible and near infra-red optical transmission exist, and the highest mobilities attainable continue to be exceeded. Additionally, these materials can be prepared using industrially mature deposition technologies such as sputtering and chemical vapour deposition without signiﬁcant degradation of the opto-electronic properties. Several explanations have been given for the high mobility in speciﬁc In2O3 and CdO based materials but none wholly explain this phenomenon. The application of high mobility TCO layers in various types of thin ﬁlm solar cells has demonstrated their potential to improve the efﬁciency of single junction, multi-junction and bifacial solar cells. However, additional aspects such as thermal stability, formation of suitable interfaces with solar cell absorbers and low temperature growth of low resistivity HMTCO ﬁlms, need to be considered. For large scale production and regardless of the end use, high mobility TCO using alternative cheaper and less hazardous host cation elements than indium and cadmium respectively, are being sought. Other conventional TCO materials based on zinc and tin which are less costly and environmentally benign are still to achieve comparable resistivity and transparency. Additionally, despite the enhanced mobility of HMTCO materials, the resistivity values remain comparable to those of ITO and AZO and the expected reduction to values below 10−4Ω cm is still challenging. Therefore, in the short to medium term, new analysis techniques may be required to learn more about underlying mechanisms for the high mobility in In2O3 and CdO based TCO ﬁlms. In the long term, non-oxide materials may need to be developed while predictions using theoretical methods like electronic band structure calculations may aid in the identiﬁcation of hitherto unknown high mobility transparent conductors.

Introduction Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers are characteristically described as thin ﬁlms that exhibit simultaneously high visible wavelength transparency and electrical conductivity. The majority of known TCO materials are n-type semiconductors where defects such as oxygen vacancies, impurity substitutions and interstitials donate electrons to the conduction band providing charge carriers for the ﬂow of electric current [1]. However, hole doping by ionised cation vacancies, impurity acceptor ion substitutions and/or oxygen interstitials which act as electron acceptors is also possible leading to ptype TCO materials [2]. Although p-type TCO materials have been reported, the commonly applied TCO materials are n-type semiconductors namely, F- or Sb-doped tin oxide, Sn- or Zn-doped indium oxide and Al-, B- or Ga-doped zinc oxide. These ﬁlms are used in low emissivity windows, gas sensors, ﬂat panel displays, thin ﬁlm transistors, light emitting diodes and solar cells, to name a few [1,3–7]. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in optimising the preparation of TCO thin ﬁlms for large area depositions required by industry such as increasing the deposition rate, low temperature processing on plastic substrates and improvement of uniformity, among others. However, the resistivity of these ﬁlms has saturated at about 10−4Ωcm though values in the range of 10−5Ωcm can be obtained under controlled laboratory conditions [7]. Other well known TCO materials are In- or Sn-doped CdO which are not widely used because of the hazardous nature of cadmium and a negative public perception against cadmium containing compounds. The resistivity ρ, of a semiconductor is related to the charge carrier density N and the carrier mobility µ by the relation 1 ρ = Nμe ð1Þ where e is the electronic charge given by 1.602×10−19C. If N is increased to reduce ρ, the TCO ﬁlm transmission especially in the near infrared (NIR) region reduces as a result of absorption by free carriers or by metal-like reﬂection. It is therefore, important that further reductions in the TCO resistivity must not adversely reduce the optical transparency of the ﬁlm. However ρ of a TCO ﬁlm may be decreased without reducing the NIR transmission by increasing µ rather than N. Fig. 1 shows the evolution of absorptance in a material with a ﬁxed carrier density (5×1020cm−3) as the mobility increases [8]. Since TCO ﬁlms useful for most applications must have a wide band gap (>3.0 eV) which requires a degenerate carrier density ≥10 20cm−3 and ideallyρ<10−3Ωcm, using Eq. (1), the corresponding Hall mobility would be µ≥62.5 cm2V−1s−1. Therefore, in this contribution, high mobility transparent conducting oxides (HMTCO) are used to refer to TCO ﬁlms which fulﬁll the above conditions and have a value of mobility ≥62.5cm2V−1s−1. Ti- and Mo-doped In2O3 (in short, ITiO and IMO respectively) are examples of TCO materials possessing high mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with high NIR transparency while maintaining low ρ~10−4Ωcm. Fig. 2 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra of several thin ﬁlms composed of ITiO, IMO, In2O3:Sn (ITO) and SnO2:F (FTO). The ITiO and IMO ﬁlms were prepared by magnetron sputtering in research laboratory conditions while the ITO and FTO ﬁlms were obtained from commercial vendors, for details refer to a previous study in [9]. The sheet resistance of the ﬁlms ranges from 6 Ω/□to 11 Ω/□and the indium based ﬁlms have a comparable resistivity ρ<2×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is slightly higher at 3.9×10−4Ωcm. While the transmission of the ITO ﬁlm begins to dip at around 950 nm, that of the IMO and ITiO ﬁlms remains high and begins to dip for wavelengths >1200 nm. Though the NIR optical loses may be further reduced by reducing N, doing so indiscriminately can decrease the conductivity and/or the optical band gap of the TCO layer and adversely affect the electrical properties and transparency in the visible wavelength region. Therefore, TCO materials with sufﬁciently high N (≥1020cm−3) while maintaining a high mobility and transparency are desirable. High mobility TCO materials have been prepared in the past but the resistivity has been greater than 10−3Ωcm because of a relatively lowN<10 19cm−3 [10,11]. Such low carrier density levels would require a Hall mobility in the excess of 400 cm2V−1s−1 to achieve ρ<10−4Ω cm. CdO is a well known material with mobility as high as µ = 146 cm2 V−1 s−1 with N=1.5×1020cm−3 [12] but is not suitable for most TCO applications because of absorptioninthe visible light spectrum as a result of a low band gap <3.0 eV and environmental issues. High mobility TCO ﬁlms with a sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and an optical transmission of ≥80% over the visible to NIR wavelengths are potentially useful to enhance solar cell efﬁciency. This is particularly useful in the case of multi-junction solar cells, consisting of stacks of different semiconductors with appropriately matched band gaps to increase the spectral response over a wide wavelength range. Ideally, the bottommost cell should receive photons that are unused by the upper absorbers and thus transmitted through the upper cells including their TCO contacts. Fig. 3 shows a graph comparing the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of single junction solar cells based on absorbers with different optical band gaps and using conventional TCO materials such as ZnO:Al and In2O3:Sn as transparent contacts. The EQE curve of the gallium rich CuIn1 −XGaXSe2 (CIGS) cell, labelled C, in Fig. 3 is unexpectedly low for energies above the theoretical band gap because of poor current collection as a result of recombination [13]. Otherwise, for all the solar cells, a signiﬁcant portion of the loss in EQE is caused by optical losses in the front contact TCO. If such solar cell structures are used in a multi-junction device, the amount of light reaching the bottom absorber (with the lowest band gap) is severely reduced causing a current mismatch [14]. When comparing the EQE of the CIS absorber represented by curve A in Fig. 3 with the TCO transmission spectra presented in Fig. 2, it is clear that improvements in the EQE, especially for wavelengths greater than 900 nm are possible if HMTCO contacts are used. Thus, HMTCO ﬁlms could potentially improve the efﬁciency of such solar cells by reducing the optical losses while minimising resistive losses. In this article strategies used to improve the carrier mobility in degenerately doped TCO thin ﬁlms are reviewed. A survey of dopant elements known to improve the mobility of In2O3 and CdO is presented. A discussion aimed at understanding the reasons for high mobility in these materials is given. Examples of the application of HMTCO ﬁlms in solar cells are described and used to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of improved NIR transmission to these devices. Finally, challenges and prospects for further development of HMTCO materials are discussed. 2. Strategies to attain high mobility in TCO materials Various strategies have been employed to increase the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms while maintaining high transparency and conductivity as reviewed by Exarhos and Zhou [15]. Traditionally, the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms has been enhanced by improving the crystalline structure by means such as heat treatment, choice of deposition technique as well as choice of substrate. Here, we expand on some of those strategies and include several other methods that are perhaps less well known, but seem promising. 2.1. Post deposition heat treatment TCO thin ﬁlms prepared without intentional substrate heating or with low process temperatures exhibit low electron mobility as a result of scattering by grain boundaries and/or point defects. Post deposition heat treatment in different ambient conditions reduces point and/or dislocation defects in the amorphous or poorly crystallised TCO ﬁlms by increasing the grain size and improving the overall crystal structure enhancing the electron mobility [3,16]. However, effective heat treatment may require temperatures approaching 1840 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 600 °C, that are unsuitable for heat sensitive substrates such as polymers or even soda lime glass which may soften and introduce undesirable impurities in the TCO ﬁlms and thus other methods have to be used. 2.2. Choice of deposition method While ﬁlm growth by highly energetic particles may increase the grain size of TCO ﬁlms, an excessive transfer of momentum may damage the ﬁlms and reduce the mobility [16]. During sputtering, the discharge voltage at the target surface repels both negative oxygen ions and neutral argon atoms, which arrive at the substrate with high kinetic energy of ~100 eV and distort the TCO crystalline structure [17]. Since the discharge voltage is less for RF sputtering than for DC sputtering, it is usual for TCO ﬁlms grown by the former method to have higher values of mobility [17,18]. The kinetic energy of particles related to pulsed laser deposition varies from 1 eV to a few 100 eV but is easier to control than in sputtering resulting in better TCO crystalline structures leading to higher mobility [19]. 2.3. Control of crystal structure using mono-crystalline substrates Control of crystal growth by using highly oriented substrates is known to enhance the mobility of TCO thin ﬁlms by improving crystallinity. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (100) is often used to grow low resistivity ITO thin ﬁlms [20]. Though the ITO crystal quality can be improved the increase in the mobility is not drastic compared to ITO prepared on glass. Therefore, other factors such as the character of the doping ions may play a role in determining the charge carrier mobility. However, the highest reported mobility for highly conductive ZnO: Al~70 cm2V−1s−1 at N>1020cm−3 has been reported for ﬁlms grown on c-plane sapphire [19]. A study of Cd2SnO4 ﬁlms grown on different substrate illustrates this point further where the mobility of the ﬁlms was measured as 609 cm2V−1s−1 (the highest reported value for a degenerate TCO material), 330 cm2V−1s−1 and 27 cm2V−1s−1 using MgO(111), MgO(100) and boro-silicate glass substrates, respectively [21]. The relatively high cost and limited suitability of these highly oriented substrates on large areas precludes the use of epitaxially grown TCO in a wide range of applications, especially displays and solar cells. 2.4. Controlling impurity concentration Hall mobility in TCO thin ﬁlms can be increased by reducing scattering caused by intrinsic crystalline defects and/or ionised impurities. A relatively high mobility in ZnO:Al up to 44.2 cm2V−1s−1 with N=3.8×1020cm−3 was achieved using a ZnO target with a low Al2O3 concentration of 0.5wt.% [22]. By minimising intrinsic defects in thin ﬁlm ZnO, a mobility of 440 cm2V−1s−1 but with a low N of<1016 cm−3 could be achieved [11]. 2.5. Selective doping methods Selective doping methods may increase the relaxation time in TCO materials by separating the doping and charge transport regions. In such cases, the charge carriers are provided by the heavily doped regions while the lightly doped regions provide a high mobility path where scattering by ionised or neutral impurities, is minimised. Zone conﬁning is achieved by applying a (quasi) periodic temperature gradient across the surface of the substrate during deposition of the TCO material [23]. Fig. 3.

The mobility values are 105 cm2V−1s−1, 77cm2V−1s−1, 27cm2V−1s−1 and 25cm2V−1s−1 for ITiO, IMO, ITO and FTO, respectively. The resistivity values of the indium based ﬁlms range from 1.3×10−4Ωcm to 1.9×10−4Ωcm while that of the FTO ﬁlm is 3.9×10−4Ωcm. Reproduced with permission from [9]. 1841 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 During ﬁlm growth, the impurities tend to accumulate in the colder areas of the substrate surface. The impurity movement and temperature gradient are mutually parallel and are perpendicular to the growth direction. The result is a ﬁlm consisting of alternate zones of heavily doped metal oxide and almost pure metal oxide (see Fig. 4a). Using this method, a high mobility of 103 cm2V−1s−1 and an average carrier density of 1.4×1021cm−3 give a resistivity of 4.4×10−5Ω cm for ITO [23,24]. However, the visible transparency of ITO prepared using this method including the substrate, was below 80% [24]. Selective doping using multi-layered ﬁlms composed of lightly and heavily doped semiconductors alternately stacked in the direction of the ﬁlm growth (see Fig. 4b), is also referred to as modulation doping [25]. Several studies predict that modulation doping may improve TCO mobility [26,27]. Simulations on multi-layered ﬁlms composed of InGaO3 (relatively large electron afﬁnity and low carrier density) alternately stacked with ZnO:Al layers (low electron afﬁnity and high carrier density) have predicted that high conductivity >4.2×104S cm−1 for carrier densities ~1020cm−3 are possible [26]. Simulations of the transport mechanisms revealed that the conductivity is very sensitive to the quantum well thickness. The authors proposed that high mobilities derived from doping modulation would require individual layers of <5 nm thick and high crystal quality materials with close lattice matching in order to avoid interface defects which would be challenging to achieve in practice [26]. A mobility of 1560 cm V−1s−1 is possible if N=1×1020cm−3 at the bottom of a 5 nm wide quantum well giving a resistivity of 4.0×10−5Ω cm. A similar simulation was performed for modulation-doped multi-layers composed of ZnO|ZnMgO|ZnMgO:Al| ZnMgO all of which are closely lattice matched [26]. Mobilities as high as 145 cm2V−1s−1 were predicted for a structure with an average carrier density of 3.8×1018cm−3 but the lowest resistivity was limited to 1.5×10−3Ω cm. Multi-layers consisting of ZnO|ZnO:Al and ZnO|Zn1−X MgXO:Al have also been prepared on a- and c-plane sapphire substrates and though the crystal structure was comparable to that of single layers, the resistivity was quite high [28]. The authors attributed this effect to the high oxidation sensitivity of the thin ﬁlms which passivated the donors and reduced the carrier density. Also, multi-layered ﬁlms consisting of the dopant oxide ﬁlms alternating with the host cation oxide have been prepared, i.e. InOX (2.0 nm)|SnOY (0.2 nm) obtaining a relatively low mobility of 17 cm2V−1s−1 and a carrier density of 5×1020cm−3 [29]. To date, the predicted high mobility cannot be obtained in thin ﬁlms prepared by modulation doping as desired for most TCO applications such as photovoltaic cells. 2.6. Hydrogen inclusion Total energy calculations based on ﬁrst principles suggest that the bond length between hydrogen and the nearest host oxygen atom in a metal oxide is virtually the same regardless of the metal [30]. Therefore, the hydrogen is “pinned” at a ﬁxed energy level which introduces shallow defect states inside the conduction band of oxides with a high electron afﬁnity leading to n-type doping. It has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates structural defects in TCO materials in the same way as is well known for thin ﬁlm silicon [31,32]. Hydrogen inclusion in TCO materials is achieved either during ﬁlm deposition or by post deposition annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere. One of the highest mobilities for ITO (μ~145 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been achieved by post deposition treatment in a hydrogen plasma [32] while that for ZnO:Al (μ~50 cm2V−1s−1 for N>1020cm−3) has been reported for ﬁlms sputtered with a small amount of hydrogen added to the sputter gas [33]. A high value of µ=130 cm2V−1s−1 for N=1.8×1020cm−3 has also been reported for hydrogen doped In2O3 [32]. 2.7. Choice of appropriate dopants The highest mobilities achieved for conventional degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms prepared by sputtering are typically 40–50 cm2V−1s−1 for ITO [16,34,35] and ZnO:Al [7,17]. However, speciﬁc elements have been used to prepare degenerate CdO and In2O3 thin ﬁlms by sputtering with µ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with transmission of >80% in the visible and near infra-red wavelength regions. While undoped CdO thin ﬁlms have a high mobility, the optical band gap is too low for use as a transparent conductor for visible light. However, doping cadmium oxide with several elements e.g. In [12], Sc [36], Y [37] and Ti [38] can lead to mobilities above 62.5 cm2V−1s−1 while maintaining N≥1020cm−3. A wider range of doping elements has been used to achieve high mobility in In2O3 thin ﬁlms such as Mo [39–41], Ti [42–47], W [48–51], Zr [42,43,52–55], and Gd [56]. Details of dopants elements leading to high mobility in CdO and In2O3 are presented later in Section 4.3. 3. Deposition methods for degenerate TCO thin ﬁlms with mobility higher than 62 cm2V−1s−1 Impurity doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms with high mobility can be prepared using a variety of methods as listed in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that though high mobility in impurity doped In2O3 can be achieved by a wide range of deposition techniques, the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and/or post deposition annealing further enhances the Hall mobility. The lowest resistivity reported for IMO thin ﬁlms to date is 6.7×10−5Ω cm with a high mobility (250cm2V−1s−1) grown at 500 °C byPLD onquartz[41]. However, the NIR opticaltransmissionis not known as a high transmittance (~90%) was only presented for visible light. 4. Understanding the mechanisms of high mobility in impurity doped CdO and In2O3 The mobility µ of an electron in semiconductors depends on the relaxation time τ, the electronic charge e and the effective carrier mass m* in the conduction band as given by the following relationship μ = eτ m* : ð2Þ Therefore, the mobility can be increased by increasing τ or by decreasing m*. Increasing τ requires ﬁlms with fewer defects which may be achieved by lower carrier density, less grain boundaries and less neutral impurities. Decreasing m*, requires semiconductors with a widely dispersed conduction band. The scattering mechanisms that govern the electron transport in semiconductors are described in detail in text books such as that by Lundstrom [64]. Of these, the scattering mechanisms relevant to ntype TCO thin ﬁlms have been identiﬁed by other authors [3,65–67]. Brieﬂy, they are: i. Grain boundary scattering caused by the discontinuity presented by grain boundaries especially in polycrystalline thin ﬁlm Fig. 4. Schematic showing charge carrier distributions in relation to the direction of ﬁlm growth of semiconductors prepared using selective doping by zone conﬁning (a) and modulation (b). The dark and light sections denote regions of high and low carrier density, respectively. 1842 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 materials. A space charge region formed around the grain boundaries and the resulting potential barrier scatters the electrons crossing this region reducing the mobility. Grain boundary scattering only signiﬁcantly affects the overall TCO mobility if the grain size is about the same as the mean free path of the charge carriers. ii. Ionised impurity scattering caused by deﬂection of free carriers by the long-range electrostatic ﬁelds associated with intentional dopants and defects such as interstitials and vacancies. iii. Optical phonon scattering caused by lattice vibrations of bonds in a polar semiconductor which induce an electric ﬁeld that interacts with a charge moving through the lattice. iv. Acoustic-phonon scattering caused by an acoustic wave propagation through a crystal lattice which causes the atoms to oscillate about their equilibrium positions and interfere with the electron motion. v. Neutral impurity scattering caused by non-ionised impurities. vi. Piezoelectric scattering which arises from electric ﬁelds caused by the strain associated with lattice vibrations in crystals where partially ionic bonds occur such that the unit cell does not contain a centre of symmetry. Matthiesen's rule states that the contribution of different scattering processes to the mobility and thus carrier transport is additive provided that the scattering mechanisms are independent [64]. Therefore for the above scattering processes, the overall mobility is given by the following relation. 1 μ = ∑ n i=1 1 μi ð3Þ where µi is the mobility due to the ith scattering mechanism. In practice, the conductivity of TCO materials cannot be increased by simultaneously increasing the carrier density and the mobility. Usually, the mobility is observed to saturate and even start to reduce as the carrier density is increased indicating dominant scattering by ionised impurities. Normally, grain boundary scattering is dominant for N≤1019cm−3 while charge impurity scattering is more signiﬁcant for N≥1019cm−3 for ITO and ZnO:Al [1,28,34,66,68]. Recent studies also suggest that for N>1019cm−3, the nature of the scattering differs for both ITO and ZnO:Al as a result of the piezoelectricity of the latter material leading to higher trap densities [66]. 4.1. Role of crystalline quality and structure Poor crystalline quality may cause a reduction in the relaxation time and thus mobility as a result of increased point defects, grain boundaries and lattice distortion. Electron transport in n-type semiconductor is facilitated by the vacant s-orbitals of neighbouring cations in the crystal lattice overlapping to form a conduction path. Moreover, if the crystal structure is disrupted by say, a cation vacancy, the spatial spread of the vacant s-orbital around that site is disrupted causing the effective mass of the electron to increase thus reducing its mobility. Therefore, shorter cation–cation bond length and a favourable distribution of the cations are believed to increase the mobility of the electrons in the semiconductor. Early work by Shannon [69] on single crystals in the CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family revealed that oxide structures with continuous edge sharing of cation octahedra are essential for conductivity in metal oxides. Later work by Ingram et al. [70] on thin ﬁlms of the same CdO–SnO2–In2O3 family extended this rule to include structures where octahedra share corners. They also classiﬁed TCO materials according to the coordination of the cations e.g. ZnO has tetrahedral coordination, while CdO, In2O3, SnO2 and other Cd containing spinel oxides have octahedral coordination. The decrease in both conductivity and mobility was also correlated to a decrease in the octahedral cation density in the structure in the order: CdO (rock salt)>In2O3 (bixbyite)>SnO2 (rutile) [70]. Studies of ZnSnO4 by Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction suggest that the unusually low mobility is a result of disorder on the cation octahedral sites which may disrupt transport between edge sharing cations [71]. Therefore, since high mobility with degenerate doping has only been reported for CdO and In2O3 based compounds with octahedrally coordinated cations, the associated cubic structure may also favour high mobility. 4.2. Role of the electronic band structure The electronic band structure of TCO materials can be studied by theoretical modelling or by measurements of the relaxation time and effective mass as well as the Hall parameters. Owing to the simple structure of CdO, the majority of theoretical electronic band structure studies have been done on this material. Freeman et al. [72,73] have identiﬁed three salient features of the electronic band structure of the conduction band of a TCO material which affect the charge carrier transport mechanisms namely, the curvature, the dispersion and the position. A parabolic conduction band minimum ensures a low effective carrier mass of the electrons which promotes high mobility. A study of the Cd1+XIn2−2XSnXO4 system shows that both the density of states effective mass and the relaxation time increase with N resulting in a cancellation effect such that the mobility is less than expected [74].

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 contrast, the effective carrier mass of IMO was determined as 0.32me and found to be independent of N implying a parabolic conduction band minimum[58].A widely dispersed conduction band minimum allows the drift of electrons unimpeded through the crystal structure resulting in a higher relaxation time and thus higher mobility. Electronic band structure calculations of InXCd1−XO thin ﬁlms for which mobility up to 91.5 cm2V−1s−1 withN>1020cm−3 was measured, revealed an electron effective mass of 0.24–0.26me and a broadening of the conduction band edge by hybridization of the Cd 5s and In 5s bands [12]. The calculated effective electron mass agrees with a value of 0.25me determined by Seebeck measurements [75]. Theoretical studies also suggest that the lowest conduction band of In2O3 is split with Sn doping due to the strong hybridization with dopant s-type states and this splitting contributes to both the decrease of the plasma frequency and the mobility of the carriers [73]. In contrast, calculations of the IMO electronic band structure suggest that high mobility is achievable in degenerate In2O3:Mo as the d-states of Mo do not hybridize with the s-states of In resulting in m* similar to undoped In2O3 [76]. 4.3. Chemical character of impurity dopant element From the descriptions given above, it can be seen that the choice of elements that induce high mobility in TCO materials has largely been empirical. Few if any studies have been conducted to ﬁnd the underlying mechanisms for high mobility caused by speciﬁc dopants. A series of studies predicted that the mobility of doped In2O3 would increase with the Lewis acid strength of the doping element and reported this effect for Ge4+, Si4+ and Sn4+ [77] as well as for Cu, Ti and Zr [78]. However, the µ of the TCO ﬁlms studied generally ranged from 45 cm2V−1s−1 to 55 cm2V−1s−1 and in some cases, the ﬁlms were non-degenerate. In this contribution, we shall attempt to apply the same principles to known degenerately doped In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms with mobility >62.5 cm2V−1s−1. The Lewis acid strength L can be calculated using a formula developed by Zhang [79] as follows L = Z r2 −7:7χz + 0:8 ð4Þ where r is the ionic radius related to the electrostatic force due to the oxidation state Z of the ion and χz is the electronegativity of the element in the respective oxidation state. Using this formula, the Lewis acid strengths of elements that are now known to induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms were compiled in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. All these ﬁlms presented are highly transparent in the visible and most (where reported) have a high near infra-red region transmission. Generally, it can be seen that the dopants which induce higher mobilities are transition elements which have a higher Lewis acid strength than the host cation. The lists in Tables 2 and 3 are not exhaustive and have been compiled, where possible, from TCO ﬁlms prepared by MOCVD or sputtering, respectively, on glass substrates to reduce the inﬂuence of the ﬁlm deposition technique on the mobility values reported. Also, these ﬁlms may not represent the highest possible mobility achieved by a given dopant. However, most of the dopants listed that induce high mobility in In2O3 and CdO are strong Lewis acids compared to Cd2+ and In3+, respectively. There are two exceptions in Table 2, namely H+ and Gd3+. The Lewis acid strength for H+ has not been calculated because of the difﬁculty in determining the ionic radius which is anyway expected to be much less than that of In3+. As mentioned previously, H+ is a shallow donor in most TCO ﬁlms with a high electron afﬁnity, hydrogen may also passivate defect states in In2O3 thus increasing theτ and improving µ [32]. However, the optical properties of H-doped In2O3 have not yet been reported. On the other hand, Gd3+ has a much higher ionic radius and a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ but corresponds to a high mobility of 128 cm2V−1s−1. Gadolinium belongs to a special group of metals known as Lanthanoids, most of which have a partially ﬁled 4f orbital, lying below group three transition metals in the periodic table and hence may warrant further investigation [80]. While doping CdO by Sn4+ and In3+ leads to µ~70 cm2V−1s−1, doping using Y3+ and Ti4+ both transition metal ions results in a drastic increase inµ. We note here that the highest mobility for CdO based material has been observed for a Cd1−XSnXO layer grown by pulsed laser deposition on MgO single crystals, as 609 cm2V−1s−1 and N=4.74×1020cm−3. Sn4+ beinga non-transition metal ion with a lower Lewis acid strength than In3+ will induce a lower mobility in In2O3 than the transition elements listed in Table 2. On the other hand, mobility values of <62.5 cm2V−1s−1 with N>1020cm−3 have been reported for nontransition metal dopants with high enough Lewis acid strengths such as Sb5+ (3.559), Ge4+(3.059) and Si4+ (8.098) [77]. According to Wen et al. [77], the high Lewis acid dopants polarise the electronic charge away from the O2−2p valence band more strongly than weaker Lewis acids, this results in screening of the charge and weakens its activity as a scattering centre hence increasing the mobility. Similarly, the reason for higher mobility in IMO compared to intrinsic In2O3 has been explained by Mo suppressing scattering by oxygen interstitials [58]. However, if the Lewis acid is too strong e.g. Ge in In2O3, the dopant has a greater afﬁnity to oxygen and may incorporate an excess of oxygen in the lattice which would then limit the µ by the introduction of scattering centres [77]. Originally, the high mobility of IMO was attributed to the higher oxidation state of Mo6+ ions that would contribute three extra electrons to the In2O3 matrix [57]. Later studies by another group suggested that Mo in IMO exists as both Mo4+ and Mo6+ for high carrier density and only as Mo6+ for ﬁlms with lower carrier density [85].

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 transition elements with a lower oxidation state such as Ti and Zr, etc showhighmobility, ahighoxidationstate isnotnecessarily aconditionfor high mobility. The charge carrier mobility and the visible light transparency of Ti-, Zr-, and Ge-doped In2O3 are much higher than that of ITO for the same dopant atomic concentration [78]. A similar comparison of In2O3 doped by Sn, Ti and Zr, all of which, can have a oxidation state +4 showed that the electron mobility and the NIR transmission were highest for the transition metal dopants [55]. Though the role of possible multiple valency e.g. of Ti as Ti2+ was not considered, these studies asserted that high mobility in In2O3 at least is only exhibited for transition metal dopants. 5. Application of high mobility TCO thin ﬁlms in solar cells At the front of a solar cell, the TCO layer acts as an electrical contact as well as a window to allow light through to the PV absorber layer. At the back of the cell, the TCO usually acts as an interfacial layer to improve the contact resistance between the PV absorber and a metallic reﬂector and also as an optical coupling layer by improving the refractive index matching. In bifacial solar cells, the back contact must act both as an electrical contact and as a window layer to let light through the back of the PV absorber layer. Since high photoconversion efﬁciency in solar cells requires minimal optical and electrical losses, a TCO layer with sheet resistance of ≤10 Ω/□and transparency of >80% over the wavelength spectrum useable by the solar cell is mandatory. High mobility TCO materials are especially desirable where a high transparency of >80% is required over a wide spectral range (400–1300 nm) such as in micro-crystalline silicon, CIGS and other multi-junction solar cells. 5.1. Single junction solar cells High mobility TCO layers can be used as front contact for single junction solar cells in the superstrate conﬁguration because the highest possible process temperatures can be used to optimise the resistivity and transparency. A record efﬁciency of 16.5% for CdTe solar cells has been achieved using CdSnO4 coated glass in the superstrate conﬁguration [86]. Also, an improved light trapping structure for nano-crystalline silicon solar cells using In2O3:Mo layers with a textured ZnO layer can increase the QE for wavelengths exceeding 900 nm compared to cells using ZnO:Al [87]. On the other hand, using In2O3:Ti, a relatively low efﬁciency of 10.7% (compared to state of the art efﬁciency ~20%) has been obtained for CIGS solar cells in the substrate conﬁguration (glass|Mo|CIGS|ZnO|ITiO) [88]. The reason for this low efﬁciency is the high series resistance of the cell caused by high resistivity of the ITiO, since the processing of ITiO could not be done at high temperatures, a problem encountered for all other high mobility TCO ﬁlms as discussed later. 5.2. Bifacial solar cells Bifacial CIGS thin ﬁlm solar cells have been prepared on ITiO coated substrates with improved efﬁciency under rear side illumination as a result of reduced NIR light absorption [89]. However, again here, since the back contact must be highly conductive, a means of processing the HMTCO at low temperature with reasonable conductivity must be developed to realise the full potential of bifacial cells. 5.3. Multi-junction solar cells The top and intermediate solar cells in a multi-junction conﬁguration require a transparent conducting contact at both the front and back of the cell to ensure efﬁcient transmission of unused light to the underlying lower band gap solar cell. CdTe with an optical band gap ~1.45 eV and amorphous silicon ~1.7 eV are examples of solid state absorber materials suitable for upper junctions in multi-junction solar cells. Also, dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) whose spectral response can be adjusted by varying the TiO2 nano-particle size or the sensitising dye, are promising candidates for the top junction in a multi-junction solar cells. CdTe solar cells with a signiﬁcantly high efﬁciency of 13.9% have been developed on Cd2SnO4 coated glass (µ~53.2 cm2V−1s−1, resistivity ρ~1.8×10−4Ω cm) while maintaining a NIR transparency of 50% for the entire device [90]. While a high efﬁciency of the top solar cell is desirable, its full impact on the entire multi-junction solar cell efﬁciency cannot be realised unless the NIR transparency is improved to ensure adequate current matching with the bottom cells [14]. Improvements in NIR transparency through a TCO|CdTe|TCO device structure to values above 60%, require the use of a HMTCO e.g. Mo- or Ti-doped In2O3, at both the front and back sides of the solar cell to reduce parasitic absorption and reﬂection losses [9]. Fig. 5 shows the NIR transmission spectra of identical CdTe solar cells using all IMO or all ITO contacts. There is a signiﬁcant gain in NIR transmission when using IMO contacts for a CdTe solar cell that would act as either a top or an intermediate absorber in a multi-junction solar cell. Such a stack requires that the rear side TCO, which has to be prepared at low temperatures over the absorber layers, is sufﬁciently conductive to prevent losses in the total cell voltage and ﬁll factor which would limit the overall photo-conversion cell efﬁciency. However, high mobility TCOs have been used to improve the total current of a tandem solar cell consisting of an Ag(In,Ga)Se2 and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell [91]. On the other hand, the TCO layers applied at both the front and rear of a dye sensitised solar cell, can be prepared using high process temperatures without the danger of destroying the mesoscopic TiO2 layers. Taking advantage of this fact, semi-transparent dye sensitised solar cells were prepared using ITiO coated glass for possible application in tandem solar cells [92]. While the NIR transparency increased to 60% compared to DSC devices using FTO coated glass, the efﬁciency was somewhat lower i.e. 5.8% compared to 8.2%, respectively [92]. The reason for the lower efﬁciency was the different growth conditions of the TiO2 interfacial layer on the smoother ITiO ﬁlms (compared to FTO) and on the elevated resistivity of the ITiO after a sintering step at 450 °C in air required to prepare the porous TiO2 absorber. A slight improvement in the DSC efﬁciency to 6.8% could be achieved by adjusting the growth conditions of the dense TiO2 interfacial layer and by heating the entire stack in vacuum after the sintering step in air [93]. The improvement occurred primarily because of increased ﬁll factor resulting from a lower series resistance due to lower resistivity ITiO layers. Heating the ITiO layer in vacuum, desorbs loosely bound oxygen at the surface creating Fig. 5.

Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 vacancies and oxygen residing along grain boundaries (if the TCO is slightly porous) thus lowering the depletion barrier along the grain boundaries, increasing the charge carrier density while improving the electron mobility, respectively. This “conduction recovery” phenomenon is used for gas sensor application and was reported in 1977 for CdIn2O4 [69] and in the early 1980s for SnO2 [94] and In2O3 [95]. 6. Challenges and prospects In 1999, Coutts et al. [96] outlined key areas of basic research to improve the opto-electronic properties of TCO thin ﬁlms focusing on the development of improved materials which can be easily applied on an industrial scale. While the HMTCO materials reviewed in this article can be prepared with µ of >62.5 cm2V−1s−1 using sputtering and MOCVD which are well developed deposition techniques for industrial fabrication, some challenges still remain. 6.1. Low mobility in TCO ﬁlms prepared with low processing temperature It is desirable to prepare thin ﬁlms at low temperatures to coat plastic substrates or pre-deposited layers of an opto-electronic device with minimal damage, to reduce the energy input into the manufacturing process and to avoid diffusion of undesirable impurities from the substrate into the TCO ﬁlms. We note here that all the low resistivity TCO materials with μ>62.5 cm2V−1s−1 in Tables 2 and 3 were prepared with deposition temperatures of at least 300 °C. The typical evolution of the ρ, N and µ values of IMO thin ﬁlms with increasing heater temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The substrate temperature in this case is not more than 10% lower than the heater temperature. These ﬁlms were prepared by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering from a ceramic In2O3:Mo (98:2 wt%) target using argon containing 0.53 vol.% of oxygen at a sputter pressure of 1.0 Pa, with further details reported elsewhere [97]. The resistivity generally reduces as the heater temperature TH increases from 25 °C to 450 °C then saturates at about 2.0×10−4Ω cm at 450 °C and 500 °C. The decrease in resistivity is caused by a concurrent increase in N and µ from 0.6×1020cm−3 to 4.5×1020cm−3 and from 9 cm2V−1s−1 to 73 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Theobservedsuppressionofmobilitytovaluesbelow62.5 cm V−1s−1 at low process temperature of >300 °C, has also been observed by other groups for In2O3:Mo [39,43,45,47,85], In2O3:Ti [45], In2O3:Zr and In2O3: Wo [49]. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra for IMO ﬁlms preparedwithoutintentional substrateheatingandwith heatingto500 °C which are described in depth elsewhere [97]. In both cases, the molybdenum exists in the oxidation states of +6 and +4 as well as an intermediate oxidation state +4<x<+6 [98,99]. The ﬁlms grown on heated substrates also contain a small amount of elemental Mo. Though the Mo6+ state is prevalent in both ﬁlms, the Mox+ species are much higher in the low temperature ﬁlm. These Mox+ species are associated withhydroxyls andothercomplex oxides,suchas Mo4O11[99] which may exist as neutral impurities in the ﬁlm and thus reduce the mobility by scattering as has also been reported for In2O3:Sn ﬁlms [34,100]. Additionally, the carrier density of the ﬁlms increases as expected from theory as the Mo6+ species exceeds the sum of the remaining Mo species in the ﬁlm. While this result agrees with some authors [57], other [85] report that the Mo4+ species rather than the Mo6+ contribute to the conduction electrons in IMO. However, both the maximum values of carrier density ~2×1020cm−3 and mobility 44 cm V−1s−1 reported in [85] are less than the corresponding values of 4×1020cm−3 and 73 cm V−1s−1 presented in Fig. 6. Nevertheless, in both cases, the dopant efﬁciency was lower than 100% indicating that some of the charge carriers could be attributed to oxygen vacancies. Table 4 lists the electrical and optical characteristics of IMO, IWO, and ITiO thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating. It can be seen that regardless of the deposition technique, the IMO ﬁlms have μ<25 cm2V−1s−1 which is slightly less than the value reported for degenerate ﬁlms of ITO [101,102] and ZnO:Al [17,103] and much less than that for intrinsic In2O3 [82,104], all deposited without intentional substrate heating. A similar problem is experienced for ﬁlms prepared using the other transition elements as dopants for In2O3 as listed in Table 4. The cause for low µ for ﬁlms prepared at low deposition temperatures is not yet fully understood. This is a major Fig. 6. Resistivity ρ (triangles), Hall mobility µ (circles) and charge carrier density N (squares) of IMO thin ﬁlms as a function of heater temperature. The lines are to guide the eye. Fig. 7. Mo 3d spectra for In2O3:Mo ﬁlms prepared without intentional heating (25°) and with a heater temperature of 500 °C. 1846 S. Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 challenge that precludes the preparation of these high mobility ﬁlms onto heat sensitive substrates. An interesting development is a signiﬁcantly high mobility between 50cm2V−1s−1 and 60cm2V−1s−1 that can be obtained in degenerate amorphous Zn-doped In2O3 ﬁlms prepared without substrate heating [111,112]. These ﬁlms have a relatively high optical transmission in the NIR wavelength region and thus may be an alternative to high mobility TCO materials for coating heat sensitive substrates. It has been proposed that since oxygen vacancies contribute signiﬁcantly to the conductivity of the IZO thin ﬁlms, Zn2+ substitution on In3+ sites does not decrease the carrier density of In2O3 ﬁlms and thus a degenerate carrier density is maintained [104,111]. Further, Zn may increase the density of oxygen vacancies by reducing some of the In–O bonds [104] or by passivating defects caused by interstitial oxygen. The results of the studies mentioned above indicate that the electronic band structure rather than crystalline structure determines the maximum attainable high mobility in TCO materials. 6.2. Inadequate characterisation and analysis methods One of the major problems in studying the limitations of mobility in TCO ﬁlms is the difﬁculty in obtaining sufﬁciently accurate values of effective mass and relaxation times which are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanisms. Data extracted from optical analysis using Drude's model and the Burstein–Moss shift has to be treated with caution because of the difﬁculties in measuring the ﬁlm thickness to a high enough accuracy and assumptions that the conduction band is parabolic, respectively [8,113]. Young et al. [114] described a four coefﬁcient method used to measure the Hall, Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients of TCO thin ﬁlms which can be used to determine the charge carrier density, mobility, the effective electron mass, the scattering mechanisms and relaxation time. However, though Hall measurements are widely used, experimental determination of the Seebeck and Nernst coefﬁcients for these high mobility TCO materials is rarely done, and hence the exact scattering mechanisms limiting the mobility can only be estimated or speculated. Studies on the electronic transport mechanisms reported for HMTCO ﬁlms so far seem to be empirical. Theoretical modelling using either computational chemistry or physics methods is a useful tool for calculating and understanding the structure and properties of materials and may even predict hitherto unknown materials with desirable transparent conducting properties. In particular, more insights into the inﬂuence of dopant chemistry, dopant concentration, and ﬁlm structure on the charge carrier transport mechanisms would aid improvements in the resistivity exhibited by these high mobility TCO materials. Developments in electronic band structure calculations may aid in predicting the material behaviour and can help to elucidate limitations to mobility and doping efﬁciency. For example, a combination of electronic band structure calculations and Seebeck measurements has been used to determine an electron effective mass of Cd2SnO4 around 0.25me [12,75] which is much higher than values of 0.08–0.11me and 0.04me, determined from the Burstein–Moss shift in the 1970s by Nozik [10] and Haacke [115], respectively. However, most of the reported theoretical electronic band structure calculations for HMTCO have focused onCdO ratherthanIn2O3,possiblybecauseofthesimplicityof theformer's rock salt structure. However since In2O3 is less hazardous material and thus more technologically important, more theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure and properties of this material are required to advance the development of TCO materials with improved conductivity. 6.3. Lack of alternative low cost and environmentally benign materials The high mobility with low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm values described in the previous sections have only been observed inmaterials based on In2O3 whichisrathercostlyandCdOwhichispotentiallyhazardousandmaynot be acceptable for environmental reasons. Efforts to dope cheaper and environmentally benign materials with transition elements have not yet resulted in higher mobility e.g. ZnO doped with Zr [116], Ti [117], Mo [33], Ta doped SnO2 [118] and Nb-doped TiO2 [119]. Also, doping ZnO with hydrogen [120] gives a mobility of ~40 cm2V−1s−1 which is comparable withvaluesforAldopingandmuchlessthanthevalueof130 cm2V−1s−1 forH-doped In2O3[32]. Itispossiblethat the wurzite structure of ZnO with tetrahedral coordination is less favourable for electron transport than the cubic structure of CdO and In2O3 both of which have an octahedral coordination [70]. In general, for the same dopant element e.g. tin, the mobility of the ﬁlms increases going from ZnO to In2O3 to CdO as Sn inclusion in ZnO causes disorder in the octahedral causing short relaxation times despite the low effective electron mass [71]. Evidently, to achieve high mobility but cheap and non-hazardous TCO materials, alternative dopants or ternary compounds of ZnO, SnO2 and possibly TiO2, need to be developed and alternative materials that may not necessarily be oxides should be investigated. Single walled carbon nano-tubes (SWNT) are an emerging p-type transparent conducting material that has low resistivity ~10−4Ω cm with transparency of >80% over the visible and near infrared wavelength regions [121]. Promising solar cell efﬁciencies have been achieved on CIGS [122] and on CdTe [123] using SWNT as transparent contacts. Improvements in SWNT for application in PV should be aimed at reducing the relatively high visible light absorption in ﬁlms thicker than 100 nm [121–123]. 6.4. High resistivity despite higher mobility Lastly, despite the elevated values of mobility reported, the resistivity of the In2O3 and CdO thin ﬁlms has remained similar to that of state of the art ITO thin ﬁlms. A lower than expected dopant activation as well as an upper limit for carrier density above which the mobility begins to reduce has been reported for In2O3:Mo [58,85,124,125], In2O3:W [48,63], In2O3:Zr [52,54] and In2O3:Ti Table 4 A survey of transition element doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms grown without intentional substrate heating.

Calnan, A.N. Tiwari / Thin Solid Films 518 (2010) 1839–1849 [44,45]. For the case of In2O3:Mo, it is possible that the reduced dopant activation efﬁciency of Mo is caused by interstitial oxygen forming neutral complexes with some of the Mo at speciﬁc substitutional sites as inferred by some authors [124] and as demonstrated by the XPS measurements discussed in Section 6.1 of this article. Examination of heavily W-doped In2O3 thin ﬁlms by Energy-Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy revealed segregation of tungsten at the grain boundaries where it is ineffective as a donor [63]. This implies that the transition element dopants limit the mobility through formation of neutral and impurity scattering centres in much the same way as observed for In2O3:Sn [34,126]. Theoretical modelling and electronic bandstructure calculationsmay beused tounderstand thelimitations to the conductivity of HMTCO ﬁlms and to predict other eligible dopants. However, for accurate and realistic results, the required calculation time as well as the hardware resources increases with the complexity of the host oxides (especially In2O3) and the (transition metal) dopant ions making accurate theoretical calculations difﬁcult. 7. Summary The literature reviewed in this contribution shows that previously stated limits for mobility in low resistivity TCO ﬁlms have been exceeded. Several high mobility TCO materials based on In2O3 and CdO that combine low resistivity with a high visible and near infra-red optical transmission exist, and the highest mobilities attainable continue to be exceeded. Additionally, these materials can be prepared using industrially mature deposition technologies such as sputtering and chemical vapour deposition without signiﬁcant degradation of the opto-electronic properties. Several explanations have been given for the high mobility in speciﬁc In2O3 and CdO based materials but none wholly explain this phenomenon. The application of high mobility TCO layers in various types of thin ﬁlm solar cells has demonstrated their potential to improve the efﬁciency of single junction, multi-junction and bifacial solar cells. However, additional aspects such as thermal stability, formation of suitable interfaces with solar cell absorbers and low temperature growth of low resistivity HMTCO ﬁlms, need to be considered. For large scale production and regardless of the end use, high mobility TCO using alternative cheaper and less hazardous host cation elements than indium and cadmium respectively, are being sought. Other conventional TCO materials based on zinc and tin which are less costly and environmentally benign are still to achieve comparable resistivity and transparency. Additionally, despite the enhanced mobility of HMTCO materials, the resistivity values remain comparable to those of ITO and AZO and the expected reduction to values below 10−4Ω cm is still challenging. Therefore, in the short to medium term, new analysis techniques may be required to learn more about underlying mechanisms for the high mobility in In2O3 and CdO based TCO ﬁlms. In the long term, non-oxide materials may need to be developed while predictions using theoretical methods like electronic band structure calculations may aid in the identiﬁcation of hitherto unknown high mobility transparent conductors.

Being different from any previous scalable c-Si photovoltaic generations, the heterojunction cell features uniquely indispensable transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers integrating a low-temperature annealing metal paste. Its unique electrode requirement is still the dominant factor to determine its rate of exposure mass manufacture. In this review, the ﬁeld of TCO development of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is overviewed ﬁrstly. Furthermore, different TCO choices for SHJ solar cells are discussed. Finally, future research directions, challenges, and potential solutions are summarized and looked forward. To conclude, we discuss what has been taken for the TCO application for SHJ solar cells in the mass market. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The world market of photovoltaics (PV) is currently dominated by crystal silicon (c-Si)-based solar cells, which occupy a market share of approximately 95% in 2019 [1,2]. Amongst c-Si solar cells, aluminum back surface ﬁeld (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells (Fig. 1a), which are also named by homojunction c-Si solar cells, are predominating in large-scale industrial solar cell products (Fig. 1b). However, due to the high carrier recombination at the silicon surface, the values of the power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of Al-BSF cells and PERC cells are reaching their limitation, which are around 20% and 24% [3], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. Besides, the polysilicon-passivated junction technique, built by embedding a thin silicon oxide layer atop a c-Si substrate, also named tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), is emerging as a promising alternative. And a record PCE of 26.4% [4] has been achieved in TOPCon cells. As an alternative, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technique is an important approach for the next generation of highefﬁciency PV productions [1,6,7], as predicted in Fig. 1d. In the 1990s, Sanyo Co. invented the ﬁrst SHJ solar cell, which integrated a boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter with an n-type c-Si wafer and achieved a PCE close to 12% [8]. And then Sanyo Co. improved the PCE to 22.8% [9] and 23.7% [10] in 2009 and 2011, respectively, in which the carrier concentration of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms was reduced to mitigate free carrier absorption (FCA), while the Hall mobility was improved to optimize the lateral conductivity. In 2013, they further enhanced the PCE to 24.7% [11]. And then, the PCE of double-side SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% [12] on a large area device of 151.9 cm2 by Kaneka Co. in 2015 due to high ﬁll factor (FF) of 83%.

All rights reserved. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 SHJ solar cells to reduce the parasitic absorption from the a-Si:H and TCO layers, resulting in a record PCE of 26.7% [13] in 2017. In 2022, SHJ solar cells based on transition metal doped indium oxide (IMO) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (m-Si:H) achieved a PCE of 25.26% [14]. And in the same year, Longi Co. raised the world-record PCE to 26.81% [15] for SHJ solar cells, approaching the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [16]. In recent years, several industry players joined the SHJ solar cell market. As predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic [2], SHJ cells are expected to gain a market share of about 10% in 2025, corresponding to a shipment of over 100 GW per year. In future mass manufacture, due to the relatively low temperatures in fabrication processes, SHJ solar cells can tolerate continually thinner c-Si thickness (up to 80 mm), which would exactly cater to the cost reduction for the PV industry. Due to the poor lateral conductivity of the doped a-Si:H layers in SHJ solar cells, the front and rear sides of the devices must be combined with transparent electrode layers to deliver the photogenerated charges to the terminals. Amongst all the materials for the transparent electrodes, TCOs are ideal candidates to meet the requirement. TCOs are intrinsically wide band-gap materials, typically metal oxides, that can be heavily doped and serve as transparent conductors for charge carrier extraction at the device terminals [17e22]. Since the 1960s and 1970s, TCOs have witnessed the revolutionary development of SHJ solar cells due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties [23e26]. Existing reviews on this topic either emphasize all aspects of SHJ solar cells or are out of date [1,7,27e29]. In other works, researchers reviewed the achievements and the challenges of TCO ﬁlms [30e32]. As TCOs are fundamental materials for SHJ solar cells, a systematic review of material selection, characterization, and gigawatt-scale production is essential but still lacking. This article reviews the general requirements and the status of the development of TCO ﬁlms targeting high-performance SHJ solar cells. In the ﬁrst section, we listed and discussed the relevant properties of TCO ﬁlms for the application in SHJ solar cells, including conductivity, transparency as well as contact resistance at the interfaces. Additionally, we also elucidated the inﬂuence factors and the control strategies for the passivation detrimental effect during the deposition of TCO ﬁlms. In the second section, we summarized the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells, focusing on their inﬂuence on work function (WF), resistivity, and transmittance on the performance of SHJ solar cells. In the third section, we presented the current state and developing trend of TCO ﬁlms in the industrialization of SHJ solar cells. 2. Application requirements of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells 2.1. Transparency, reﬂectance, and conductivity of TCO ﬁlms In SHJ solar cells, both optical and electrical properties are signiﬁcant for TCO ﬁlms. However, there is always a trade-off between these two properties. The improvement of the transparency of the Fig. 1.

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 2 TCO ﬁlms always leads to the reduction of the conductivity, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the optical and electrical properties of TCO ﬁlms to achieve desirable performance in SHJ solar cells. As bifacial devices, the performance of SHJ solar cells is primarily inﬂuenced by the optical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, including transparency and antireﬂection (AR) properties, at both the front and rear sides. The transparency of the TCO ﬁlms is mainly determined by the band structure and the deposition condition [33]. For application in SHJ solar cells, the material should possess decent transmittance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. For this reason, typical metal oxides with a fundamental bandgap larger than 3 eV [33,34], including indium oxide (In2O3) [35], tin oxide (SnO2) [36,37], and zinc oxide (ZnO) [35,38], are widely applied in TCO ﬁlms. To improve their conductivity, the metal oxides are doped by other elements to shift the Fermi level into the conduction band, during which the free carrier concentration (Ne) in the oxides is improved. The transmittance toward the long wavelength region is tremendously affected by Ne. According to Drude theory, the plasma frequency u could be written as Equation (1) [39,40]: u2 ¼ e2$Ne ε0$εr$m* (1) where, e is the electric charge carried by a single electron, and ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. The plasma frequency deﬁned the onset of the FCA, thus the increase of Ne would reduce the transmittance of the TCO ﬁlms at a long wavelength range. Generally, TCO ﬁlms also act the role of AR coatings, which determines the thickness of the ﬁlms. The reﬂectance on the Si surface is minimized for one wavelength, which is given by Ref. [33]: dTCO ¼ l 4n (2) where, l is the wavelength at which the reﬂectance is minimized, n is the refractive index of the TCO ﬁlms at the wavelength, and dTCO is the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. Generally, to achieve the best PCE performance, the solar cell should present the lowest reﬂectance at the visible light range (400e760 nm), which determines the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. For example, for indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlms on the front side of the SHJ solar cells, the thickness is generally set at 70e80 nm since ITO exhibits an n of approximately 1.9 at the wavelength of 580 nm [41]. For the TCO ﬁlms on the rear sides, the thickness could be a bit larger to mitigate the sheet resistance (Rsheet) at the cost of reducing the PCE measured at the rear side (for bifacial cells). In SHJ solar cells, the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms determines the pitch of the metal grids. A decrease of Rsheet allows a larger pitch of the metal grid, which then beneﬁts the cell performance by reducing themetal shading area as well as improving lateral transportation. Since Rsheet is deﬁned as Rsheet ¼ r/dTCO, either reducing electrical resistivity (r) or accumulating dTCO enables Rsheet smaller. However, as discussed above, dTCO is determined mainly by the antireﬂectance performance. In the TCO ﬁlms, the relationships among resistivity r, Ne, and the carrier mobility (m) could be described as Equation (3) [42], r ¼ 1 eNem (3) Either the improvement of Ne or m leads to a decrease in r, which further reduces Rsheet and improves FF in solar cells. Most TCO materials are n-type semiconductors, and Ne of their ﬁlms is primarily determined by the dopant concentration in the host materials. Besides, Ne could also be tuned by deposition conditions, such as deposition power [43], the pressure of the chamber [44], partial pressure of oxygen [45e47] and water [48,49] etc, which results in a value of Ne in the range from 1019 to 1021 cm3 [50]. Since the increase of Ne degrades the transparency of the TCO ﬁlms in the visible and near-infrared region, the best strategy to reduce Rsheet is to increase m while limiting Ne. The m in n-type materials could be written as Equation (4) [33,51], m ¼ et m* (4) where, t is the relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band, respectively. Different scattering mechanisms caused by ionized impurities, neutral impurities, or gain boundaries have an impact on the relaxation time of the carriers in the TCO ﬁlms and decrease m [33,51]. For the ITO ﬁlms applied in SHJ solar cells, typical motilities are 20e40 cm2/(V$s) [35,52]. Therefore, as the aspect of the solar cell performance, it is a trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. The increase of Ne leads to an improvement in conductivity but a reduction in transparency, while the decrease results in a contrary result. To balance the optical and the electrical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, the ﬁgure of merit (FTC) is intruded to evaluate the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms on solar cell performance, which is deﬁned as Equation (5) [53]: FTC ¼ T10 avg Rsheet (5) With the Tavg the average of the transmittance of the ﬁlms. The larger FTC means a better compromise between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms, which leads to better performance of the solar cells. 2.2. Carrier transportation at TCO interfaces In the structure of SHJ solar cells, TCO ﬁlms connect the carrier selective layers and the metal electrodes, enabling the TCO ﬁlms important roles in carrier transportation at the interfaces. Amongst all the interfaces in SHJ solar cells, the carrier transportation at the TCO/doped a-Si:H interfaces has a critical contribution to the series resistivity losses [54,55]. To study the contact resistivity (rc) at the interfaces, the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts are generally considered as Schottky contacts, in which the carrier transportation is typically governed by the energy band alignment [56,57]. According to simulation results, the WF difference between the TCO ﬁlm and the a-Si:H layer has a strong inﬂuence on the contact resistance [58,59]. That means the WF requirements for the TCO ﬁlms of the electron contact (TCO/a-Si(n)) and the hole contact (TCO/a-Si(p)) are different. As reported by Ritzau et al. [56], as shown in Fig. 2a, for the ideal electron contacts, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be lower than 4.2 eV, which is close to the Fermi level of the a-Si:H(n) layers. While for the hole contacts at the TCO/a-Si:H(p) interfaces, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be higher than that of the a-Si:H(p) layers (~5.3 eV) [60]. However, the TCO materials applied in SHJ solar cells are typically n-type semiconductors with relatively low WFs, such as ITO (4.2e4.5eV) [36,37], aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) (3.4e4.5eV) [61], etc, which do not meet the requirements for the hole contacts. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the patterns with the aSi:H(p)/ITO or a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact exhibit lower open circuit voltages (VOCs) at high illumination intensity than the ones with a W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 3 high WF WOx layer, conﬁrming that large Schottky barriers are formed in the former contacts and hinder carrier transportation at the interfaces. To suppress rc of the hole contacts, high WF transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxides (MoOx) [61e63], tungsten oxides (WOx) [61,64,65], and vanadium oxides (VOx) [66], are integrated into SHJ solar cells as contact modiﬁcation layers. Regarding the a-Si:H(p) layers, a sufﬁciently high net doping concentration is necessary to optimize rc by avoiding the hole-selective layer from being depleted [55,67,68]. But the rising of the doping concentration burdens the defect densities in the a-Si:H layers [69,70], ﬁxing the effective net doping at a level below 1017 cm3. To realize this strategy, doped hydrogenated nano- or microcrystalSi (nc-Si:H [68,71] or mc-Si:H [14]) layers, in which the effective net doping level could be higher than 1019 cm3, are integrated into SHJ solar cells, alternating the doped a-Si:H layers. Zhao et al. reported SHJ solar cells with the nc-Si:H(p)/ITO contact and achieved low contact resistance (rc of 0.144 U,cm2) successfully [72]. As discussed above, the traditional transportation exploration at the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts is mainly based on direct tunneling (DT), which is highly dependent on energy alignment. While in recent works, besides the DT mode, indirect tunneling (IDT) modes, such as trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and band-to-band tunneling (B2BT), are taken into consideration as well in the simulation of charge carrier transportation at the hole and the electron contacts in SHJ solar cell. Fig. 3a and b show typical carrier transport processes based on the DT and IDT modes at the n- and the p-contact. At the n-contact, the carrier transportation is primarily dominated by the DT mode and supported by TAT mode partially. While at the p-contact, the IDT mode is the dominant one instead of the DT mode. Regarding carrier transportation by either DT or IDT, the charge Ne of TCO ﬁlms plays an important role. On the one hand, the increase of Ne leads to the decrease of the WFs of TCO ﬁlms [73], which beneﬁts DT at the electron contact but deteriorates the WF mismatch at the hole contact. On the other hand, larger Ne is beneﬁcial for IDT on both sides of the solar cells [70,73,74]. Therefore, large Ne in TCO ﬁlms is helpful to maintain low rc at the electron contact areas. While for the hole contacts, due to the WF mismatch, the carrier transportation at the interfaces is primarily determined by IDT but is also impacted by the energy alignment. So, appropriate Ne of the ITO ﬁlms is required for the hole contacts with small rc. In Fig. 3c, rc for the hole contacts is plotted against Ne of the TCO ﬁlms [70]. At the active energy (Ea) of the a-Si:H(p) layer at 275 meV, the lowest rc is located at Ne value of approximately 2 1020 cm3. When the Ne rises above this value, the rc slightly increases due to the WF mismatch, while the rc rises monotonically with the reducing Ne below 2 1020 cm3. The TCO/metal contacts on both sides of the SHJ solar cells are another important factor that should be taken into consideration. In the manufacture of SHJ solar cells, screen printing with lowtemperature sintering metal pastes is the most widely applied technique for metallization. During this process, silver (Ag) or silver-coated copper (Ag@Cu) pastes are printed on the TCO surfaces, and metal grid electrodes are formed after drying and sintering processes with temperatures less than 200 C. Generally, the rc of the TCO/silver grid contacts (rc, TCO/Ag) is primarily dominated by the Ne in TCO ﬁlms [75]. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO/metal contacts are always treated as Schottky contacts [75]. As a highly doped semiconductor (Ne > 1019 cm3), ﬁeld emission (FE) or thermionic ﬁeld emission (TFE) is the dominant transportation mode at the contact [75,76]. According to the Schottky metal/semiconductor junction theory, an increase in Ne in TCO ﬁlms leads to a thinner potential barrier at the TCO/metal interfaces. Hence, the chance of charge carrier tunneling through the barriers should be enhanced, and rc,TCO/Ag is reduced accordingly. As shown in Fig. 3d, Schube et al. proved that rc,ITO/Ag decreases with the increase of Ne in the ITO layers under similar printing and sintering conditions [77]. 2.3. Degradation of passivation during deposition of TCO ﬁlms In recent years, deposition techniques with less damage impact on the a-Si:H layers, such as reactive plasma deposition (RPD) [78], atom layer deposition (ALD) [79e81], and sputtering with mirror shape target conﬁguration [82,83], have been investigated to fabricate TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells. However, conventional pulsed or direct current magnetron sputtering is still the most widely used deposition technique in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, owing to their high deposition rates and scalability. During the sputtering of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated silicon substrate interacts withthe plasma intensively, and a signiﬁcant degradation occurs in the passivation interfaces, leading to a reduction of VOC and pseudo-FF in the solar cell performance [84]. The detrimental effect during sputtering primarily arises from ultraviolet (UV) light luminescence [85,86] in plasma and ion bombardment [87,88], including ion and neutral particles from plasma gas, sputtering targets, and their compounds [89]. And the passivation quality could be partially recovered after a high-temperature treatment during or after the TCO deposition process [84,86]. UV radiation is believed as a damage source for the a-Si: H passivation in SHJ solar cells for a long time [85,90,91]. During the deposition processes of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated Si substrates are under the illumination of plasma and damage occurs in the a-Si:H ﬁlms or at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces. In a-Si:H ﬁlms, the Fig. 2. (a) The simulated ﬁll factor as a function of the work function and a-Si:H doping (n/p type) [56]. (b) Patterns of Suns-VOC measurements (open circuit voltages measured with different illumination) of the p-contact at high illumination intensity (the inset is the respective structure in the measurements) [56].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 4 binding energy of SieH and SieSi is approximately 3.6 eV [92] and 2.5 eV [93], respectively, which is in the UVevisible spectral range. After the illumination of UV light in plasma, the SieSi and the SieH bonds in a-Si:H(i) or a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are partially broken and then the passivation effect of the Si substrates is degraded [86]. B. Demaurex et al. show that the minority carrier lifetime (MCLT) of the a-Si:H passivated Si samples shielded with normal glasses (10% transparency at 4.7 eV) and quartz glasses (10% transparency at 7.8 eV) dropped 14% and 27% after sputtering, respectively, comparing with a value of 96% on bare samples without shielding [86]. It has been proven that the damage should be ascribed to plasma luminescence. During the plasma illuminating process, the surface recombination velocity of the samples would be degraded after a short exposure of 10 s and reach a saturation value after ~60 s [87]. It was interpreted that the UV light triggers the generation of fast metastable defects at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface in several seconds, and the reversible defects become saturated in a minute. Ion bombardment is the most critical part of the detrimental effects. During deposition, the MCLT losses of the passivated Si wafer could be more than 90%, as compared with that before deposition [43,84,86,94]. And merely part of the losses could be recovered after annealing. Generally, the detrimental effects of the particle bombardment are correlated with the thickness of the a-Si: H layer [95], the deposition conditions [89,96] as well as the deposition modes [84,97,98]. The a-Si:H layer with enough thickness enables the protection of the silicon wafer from any damage caused by bombardment during sputtering. However, due to the parasitic absorption [52] and the high resistive property [55,74], the increase of the a-Si:H layer can signiﬁcantly contribute to optical and series resistance losses in solar cells. As reported by L. Tutsch et al., the MCLTs of the wafers passivated with >7-nm-thick aSi:H(i) layers are almost fully restored after sputtering and after sputtering annealing, while the samples with 7-nm-thick passivation layers exhibit severe detrimental effects [95]. It is consistent with the thickness of a-Si:H stacks in SHJ solar cells, which lies approximately 10 nm [14]. Regarding deposition conditions, the degradation induced by ion bombardment could be suppressed by either decreasing the power applied to the targets or increasing the chamber pressure during sputtering [95]. The passivation degradation caused by ion bombardment should be correlated with either ion kinetic energy [99,100] or ion ﬂux [86,87]. Reduction of the power leads to a decrease of the current and voltage on the target, thereby lowing both the ion ﬂux and ion kinetic energy in the plasma deposition process [95]. On the other hand, the improvement of the chamber Fig. 3. The schematic band diagrams and carrier transport mechanisms for (a) the n-contact and (b) the p-contact [73].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 5 pressure increases the possibility of being scattered on their way toward the substrate, which then reduces the kinetic energy and the damage of bombardment [95]. L. Tutsch et al. utilized a thin ITO ﬁlm of several nanometers, which was deposited with relatively low power and high chamber pressure to protect the a-Si:H(i) layers-passivated Si wafer from the damage of ion bombardment [43]. As a result, the lifetime of the protected samples was improved by several folds, and their iVoc was enhanced for ~26 mV in comparison with the baseline samples. The comparison of passivation degradation among different sputtering modes, including radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), and pulsed DC modes, was summarized [84,97,98]. Due to the lower target voltage (RF: 112 V, DC: >200 V), RF sputtering exhibits less bombardmentinduced damage to the passivated substrates both after sputtering and recovering after annealing. Regardless of the damage sources in the TCO deposition process, the a-Si:H-based surface passivation can be recovered by 180e200 C thermal annealing either during or after the deposition [87,101,102]. During the thermal treatment process, the carrier concentration at the c-Si surface (band bending) would be tuned. It was reported that the surface defects in a-Si:H passivation layers can be eliminated after annealing at 180 C [101]. This effect is due to the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the a-Si:H(i) bulk toward dangling bonds at the c-Si surface, and the latter is then passivated by the formation of monohydrides. It is likely that the repassivation of dangling bonds, caused by the sputter-induced SieH bond rupture, follows the same principles. As reported by Demaurex et al. [86], the microstructural modiﬁcation in the a-Si:H layers after sputtering and annealing was investigated by a Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement. In this report, the authors showed that both monohydride and multihydride bonds in the a-Si:H layers were descended after sputtering, while the hydride bonds recovered partially after short annealing. 3. Classiﬁcation of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells Due to its superior photoelectric property and long-term stability, ITO is widely used in optoelectronic applications and has become the standard material for SHJ solar cells [1,7]. Meanwhile, the optoelectrical performance can be further improved by tuning the composition or interface modiﬁcation. To reduce the use of the rare indium element, it is an attractive way to ﬁnd low-cost substitutes with indium-based TCOs. AZO is a natively polycrystalline material with lower electronic quality than ITO when deposited at low temperatures (<200 C) and as a thin layer (<100 nm), making it an attractive low-cost substitute [31,103]. Indium-based oxides [45,98,104e108] and zinc-based oxides [109e115] are the most widely studied two TCO categories in SHJ solar cells. Each of them has its limitations. In this section, we attempt to review the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells and their performance in SHJ solar cells. 3.1. Doped indium oxides In recent years, indium-based TCOs have attracted wide attention and been reviewed, thanks to their high conductivity to ensure the transportation of photogenerated charges as well as outstanding transparency to the sun spectrum [19]. Despite the limited indium content in the earth's crust, various cation-doped In2O3 have been investigated so far in SHJ solar cells [24,25]. Indium oxide doped with hydrogen, tin, tungsten, cerium, etc. are commonly used TCO materials in SHJ cells. In the following part, roadmaps toward higher efﬁciency by using indium-based oxides as TCOs in SHJ solar cells would be discussed. 3.1.1. ITO Currently, more than 70% of indium is used in the production of ITO materials, which subsequently has broadly been applied as TCO ﬁlms in the production of industrial SHJ solar cells [24,25]. The relatively low resistivity, high transparency, and large-scale production capability make ITO well-suited for displaying the transport channel layer on both sides in SHJ solar cells. Additionally, long-time stability and facile production are other factors to contribute ITO as the dominant TCO electrodes. Consequently, continuous improvements in industrial PCE performance have been obtained, and the breakthrough efﬁciency of double-side contacted SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% in 2015 [12], a world record, surpassing the champion efﬁciency of homojunction PERC cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Kaneka Corp. published their work on IBCSHJ (structure as Fig. 4b) with the ﬁrst silicon solar cell exceeding a PCE of 26% with a FF of 83.8% [24]. Later in 2017, further progress in eliminating the parasitic absorption of a-Si:H layers by using IBC structures was reported to be a PCE of 26.7% [13]. A world-record PCE of 26.81% is achieved by LONGI Co. in 2022. However, compared with the theoretical PCE limit (close to the 28.5% theoretical ceiling predicted for a 1.1 eV band gap material), there is still a noticeable gap for the further development of ITO in SHJ solar cells in the coming years. Most notably, the PCE of current SHJ devices is limited by the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. Due to the relatively low carrier mobility, which is generally below 40 cm2/(Vs), ITO ﬁlms are not able to achieve high transparency and decent conductivity at the same time [1,21,24,117]. That tradeoff limits the improvement of the solar cell PCE. Moreover, the strategies of pattern processing structures or multilayer reﬂectors have been reported that do not balance the conﬂicting optical and electrical properties of ITO in SHJ devices [24,117e119], but any additional layers and processes might burden the cost and complexity for the cell fabrication process. Thus, the approach for developing new TCOs with high carrier mobility and low extinction coefﬁcient is necessary. 3.1.2. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) By alternating tin in ITO materials with hydrogen to form hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H), a high m of 100 cm2/(Vs) has been achieved. The IO:H ﬁlms exhibit extremely low solar-average absorption, coming in as one of the most ideal materials to replace ITO at the front side (Fig. 5a) [39,55,120,121e124]. By replacing the front ITO layer with IO:H, Koida et al. demonstrated a PCE of 16.1% for the SHJ solar cells [122]. A large-scale (153.4 cm2) device with a PCE of 21.13% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.18 mA/cm2 was exhibited, showing an obvious enhancement compared to the ITO counterparts (Fig. 5b) [125]. Indeed, the incorporation of the IO:H ﬁlms, instead of the conventional ITO ﬁlms, enhances the Jsc and the resulting PCE. The detailed analysis of the solar cells revealed that the appearance of hydrogen atoms as single-charged donors and their ability to passivate defects at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline ﬁlms led to the reduction of reﬂection loss at the IO:H/a-Si:H interface and less optical absorption in the IO:H layers [39,120,123,124]. Compared with ITO and IZO ﬁlms, the resulting IO:H ﬁlms feature both high carrier mobility (with the best value of 100 cm2/V$s) and large band gap values after annealing, which contribute to the Jsc of 39.18 mA/cm2 [125]. Compared with the ITO materials, IO:H suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the metal front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting an ITO layer between IO:H and Ag [120]. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, low Rsheet as well as small free-carrier absorption, outperforming the IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells (Fig. 5c) [120]. A remarkable PCE of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen- W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 6 printed SHJ solar cell was obtained by employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide. Nevertheless, copper plating was also investigated to reduce the expensive silver usage. A certiﬁed solar cell device with a PCE of 22.5% (FF of 80%) is demonstrated utilizing the combination of a-Si:H/MoOx, layers, IO:H ﬁlms, and copper-plated grids (Fig. 5d) [126]. These results demonstrate that IO:H is quite an attractive alternative to ITO for SHJ solar cells. 3.1.3. Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), the substitution of W6þ for In3þ, is a kind of TCO ﬁlm that can provide more carriers while reducing the defect concentration, compared to ITO ﬁlms [127]. IWO ﬁlms show high carrier mobility values of 50e80 cm2/(Vs) [19]. Beneﬁting from their high electron mobility, IWO layers not only yield low resistivity but also show high NIR transmittance (94.21% at a 80 nm thickness). Moreover, there are many Fig. 4.

Due to the high carrier mobility, IWO materials are integrated into SHJ solar cells as transparent electrode layers on both the front and the rear sides, reducing both Rsheet and FCA and leading to improved performances in the solar cells (Fig. 6a). In the early stage, to obtain appropriate carrier mobility above 60 cm2/(Vs), the deposition temperature was higher than 300 C for a long time [128]. However, this is contrary to the low process temperature requirement of SHJ solar cells. Subsequently, a series of low-temperature technologies were reported to adapt the application environment for SHJ solar cells, such as low-damage RPD or room-temperature sputtering technology [1,127e132]. Consequently, improved performances were achieved for the IWO-based SHJ solar cells to exceed 20% (Table 1). With the application of high-performance titanium and tungsten co-doped indium oxide ﬁlms, large-scale SHJ solar cells (243.34 cm2) with a high average PCE of 23.8% (with a Voc of 0.746 V, a Jsc of 38.7 mA/ cm2 and FF of 82.9%) were fabricated, in which the PCE was still lower than that for the record ITO-based SHJ solar cells yet [133]. Similar to the a-Si:H/ITO interface, the a-Si:H/IWO interfacial contact is also one of the crucial factors limiting the PCEs of the SHJ solar cells. A series of strategies are applied to optimize the Schottky barrier between p-a-Si:H and IWO. One approach is to apply MgF2 as a double-layer AR coating on top of the optimal device, the EQEintegrated Jsc was improved from 39.41 mA/cm2 to 40.16 mA/cm2 [128]. The ﬁnal 8.97-cm2 wide IWO/MgF2-based solar cell showed an active area cell efﬁciency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efﬁciency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b, Table 1) [128]. Additionally, the H diffusion from a-Si:H to tungsten-doped indium (IWOH) is reported to not only reduce the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms but also optimize the interfaces of a-Si:H/IWO [130]. The improved PCE of 22.3% for the IWOH-based solar cells was achieved on an average for 4cm2 SHJ cells, which have higher Jsc and PCEs than the IWO-based solar cell and similar FF [130]. Further, the prolonged hydrogen annealing process for the IWO-based solar cells gained the PCE by 1.14% to 23.31%, with a device area of 244.5 cm2 [129]. The aspect of electrical and optical properties, IWO is a desirable material for industrial SHJ solar cells, especially in solar cells with low-cost copper conductor grids [138]. A SHJ solar cell with copper as the metal grids and IWO as the transparent electrodes, which are fabricated in the lab and SIMIT's R&D line, reached a PCE of over 22%, showing great potential for the copper metallization of the SHJ solar cells with reduced cost and overcoming the limitations of screen-printing technology (Fig. 6c) [131]. By now, there is a consensus within the industrialization of IWO that the content of indium in the excellent performance of IWO (In:W ¼ 95:5) is still insufﬁciently ideal [128,129,137,133], where the high production costs would the pressing issue. In a word, IWO can provide advantages over ITO due to its lower absorption in the long wavelength region. However, there is still room for further improvement in conversion efﬁciency. Fig. 6.

Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 8 3.1.4. Alternative doped indium oxide To date, there are indium-based TCOs with other doping metals such as cerium, titanium, and zirconium, which mainly perform as front transparent electrodes for the solar cells having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region [78,125,139e141]. The large potential of the optimally processed In2O3:Ce:H (ICO:H) window layers in SHJ cells is demonstrated, quantiﬁed by the improvement in Jsc of 0.6 mA/cm2 without impairing the resistive losses in comparison to the usage of baseline ITO layers [139]. By further incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional ITO and IO:H ﬁlms, an improved PCE of 24.1%, a Voc of 745 mV, a Jsc of 38.8 mA/ cm2, and a FF of 83.2% were obtained [78]. It is believed that their high carrier mobility of 140 cm2/(V$s) contributed to their high efﬁciency. Already, SHJ solar cells with the optimized indium zirconium oxide (IZrO) front electrodes resulted in a Jsc of 40 mA/cm2, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 23.4% [141]. A heterojunction solar cell with an ITO/IZrO bilayer electrode succeeds in a Jsc of 38.72 mA/ cm2, a FF of 82.39%, and a PCE of up to 23.59% [140]. Similarly, the signiﬁcant reduction of the reﬂection loss of the conventional and needle-like Hf-doped In2O3 (IHFO) bilayer ﬁlms deposited on the textured silicon was observed. The short-circuit current and efﬁciency of the solar cell were improved by 0.52 mA/cm2 and 0.39%, utilizing a needle-like IHFO thin ﬁlm as an AR layer [134]. As for the manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells increases or future tandem devices, there are signiﬁcant concerns about the use of indium. The values of indium consumption per cell and per generated power for SHJ solar cells from different sources exhibited large discrepancies, but all available data indicate concern about the insufﬁcient supply of indium to support in the future [25]. Signiﬁcantly, reducing indium consumption for TCO ﬁlms has become mandatory to push SHJ solar cell technology toward a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. As an alternative to minimizing the use of metallic indium, thin indiumbased TCOs (with better performance) or the IBC cell design might be a choice. With a reduced thickness of approximately 30 nm for ITO layers, the resource-sustainable manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells would be substantially increased to 115e330 GW. However, this would only account for approximately 5e10% of a 3 TW market size, suggesting that the SHJ solar cell using ITO in some form remains a niche product. Moreover, reducing the thickness of ITO layers could also lead to signiﬁcant increases in rc due to the changes in current pathways and the current crowding effect. For example, 20-nm-thick ITO capped by a non-indiumbased TCO would greatly increase the sustainable manufacturing capacity compared to the present implementation for SHJ solar cells relying solely on ITO [25]. Thus, substituting part or full of ITO with a more transparent and less expensive dielectric indium-free ﬁlm is promising. 3.2. Doped zinc oxide Typically, an approximately 70-nm-thick ITO layer is used on each surface to form thin transparent conductive layers at the front and rear of the SHJ solar cells, corresponding to approximately 5.7 mg/W consumption of ITO and 4.2 mg/W consumption of indium, with an assumed cell PCE of 25.11% [25]. Thus, the future of cSi PVs would beneﬁt greatly from any alternative indium-free layer to circumvent the parasitic absorption in TCOs. As for the choice of indium-free TCOs in SHJ, AZOs, with low cost, abundant material reserves in nature and capability of achieving comparable efﬁciencies to the ITO-based SHJ solar cells, has been considered as one of the few potential alternatives to ITOs [109,142]. To reduce the use of indium, both ITO 50%/AZO 50% and ITO 25%/ AZO 50%/ITO 25% were used on the back of SHJ solar cells with a decent performance, which was close to that of individual ITO (Fig. 7a) [114]. The performance of the SHJ solar cells with such two kinds of TCO stacks as the back TCO layers was greatly improved compared to that with the individual AZO layer [114]. Meanwhile, the PCE gap between such the ITO/AZO stacks and the individual ITO stack could be narrowed to approximately 0.1% (absolute value), showing the possibility of applying the ITO/AZO stack structure in the SHJ solar cell [114]. Considering the use of indium-free TCOs, the AZO layers were used in three different cell conﬁgurations labeled as ‘front-AZO cell’, ‘back-AZO cell’. and ‘all-AZO cell’ [144]. At the early stage, it was found that the PCE was challenging to exceed 20% for the SHJ solar cells with the direct application of the individual AZO ﬁlm as a front-AZO cell (Table 2) [109,142]. For further improving the light coupling by textured AZO or the implementation of the electrochemically grown ZnO nanorod as AR layers on AZO, less discernible enhancement of the PCE was observed (Fig. 7b) [142]. Thanks to the optimization of experimental conditions for AZO, the abovementioned front AZO cell showed an overall increasing PCE of over 20% [143]. The low PCE was attributed to the poor contact of aSi:H(p)/AZO and the low electrical and optical properties of AZO. The optimized low-resistivity a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact by the implementation of a trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) doped a-Si:H(p) ﬁlm as a hole transport layer enables a FF above 81% and a PCE of 23.6% for the front-AZO SHJ solar cells, comparable with 23.7%-efﬁcient cells using traditional ITO (Fig. 7c) [143]. In addition, the back-AZO cell experienced a similar performance improvement path as that of the front-AZO cell. Featuring a standard screen-printed silver grid at the front with approximately 3.25% optical shadowing, a champion device of the black-AZO cell a Jsc of up to 40.81 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 23.96% was obtained [112]. As for all-AZO cells, a 4-cm2 cell was certiﬁed at ISFH CalTec with an efﬁciency of 23.0%, a VOC of 738.8 mV, a FF of 80.3%, and a JSC of 38.7 mA/cm2 [145].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 9 Furthermore, an all-AZO cell with a 244 cm2 total area reached a PCE as high as 21.3% by using an amorphous silicon oxide layer (aSiO2) as an AR coating. Thus far, AZO appeared to be a promising indium-free alternative material to replace the back ITO commonly used in SHJ solar cells. Remarkably, the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved problem [113,145]. Signiﬁcantly increasing electrical resistivity and surface degradation were obtained, when the AZO is exposed to a harsh environment (e.g. annealing in the air or humidity damping). Damp heat test results of encapsulated SHJ devices with AZO as the TCO ﬁlms exhibited relative FF degradation of 7% after 1000 h [145]. This drawback prevents AZO ﬁlms to be deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices. Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of effort still needs to be put into battle with the relatively poor conductivity and long-term stability of AZO layers. For example, the FF degradation rate might reduce with the deposition of a-SiO2 or SiNx under humid conditions [145]. However, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance. 3.3. Other TCOs Alternatively, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and graphene have also attracted attention [146e151]. Ag NWselectrodes can be deposited on top of the SHJ structure by mechanical transfer or solution technologies while achieving excellent transmittance and conductivity. However, Ag was reported to maintain low contact resistance between the silicon layer and metal, but it could easily react with a thin-ﬁlm silicon layer to form an insulating layer of AgO that blocks charge extraction. The issues remain to be tackled in the other metal-based TCOs, such as Ti, Cu, et al. [23] By inserting a SiNx layer to suppress the deterioration of the passivation quality of the Ti layer induced by direct metal-to-a-Si:H contacts, an indium-free design for SHJ solar cells achieve low series resistivity, a decent FF (80.7%), and efﬁciencies (>22%) [118]. Regarding graphene-based TCOs, until now, it is still arguable for use as a transparent electrode for any solar cell, since it would absorb signiﬁcantly over the full spectrum and shows large Rsheet [147]. 4. TCO ﬁlms for practical applications In mass production, rear-emitter (RE) structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n)/TCO/metal) are nowadays widely applied in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, taking the place of the traditional front emitter structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/TCO/metal) [7,14,152]. As discussed above , it is a trade-off between lateral conductivity and transparency in TCO ﬁlms. And in RE structures, by alternating the p/n junction with the high/low junction [32,152,153] at the front side, the lateral transport of the free carriers partially shifted from the TCO ﬁlms into the Si wafer, slightly decreasing the Rsheet. As a result, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties becomes less stringent at the front side [119,153]. Therefore, the requirements of the TCO ﬁlms for the front and the rear sides are different, depending on the structures of the SHJ solar cells. In RE structures, the requirement of the front side TCO ﬁlms is primarily on their optical properties rather than their electrical ones, which means low absorption and high carrier mobility but relatively low Fig. 7.

While the rear side needs better electron properties like relatively high carrier density and high carrier mobility. ITO materials have been widely applied as transparent electrodes, ever since the beginning of the SHJ solar cell development. It has been proven that the ratio of In:Sn played an important role in manipulating the carrier density, mobility, and transmittance of the ITO ﬁlms [59]. In SHJ solar cell mass production, 97/3-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 97/3) are chosen as the front TCO layers due to their excellent transparent capacity [154]. While 90/10-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 90/10) are integrated on the rear sides because of their low resistance [154]. With the improvement of PCEs of the SHJ solar cells, the relatively low carrier mobility of the ITO materials of less than 40 cm/(V$s) is gradually becoming a limiting factor, especially on the front side. Therefore, to improve the PCE of the SHJ solar cells, TCO materials with excellent transparency and high carrier mobility are introduced into the cells. Dong et al. [14]. selected a multidoped indium-based material IMO:H to enhance the charge mobility of the front TCO ﬁlms, and a certiﬁed PCE of 25.26% is accomplished. The IMO:H layers exhibited high carrier mobility of over 70 cm/(V$s) at a Ne of around 2 1020 cm3 and improved transmittance within below the 400-nm-wavelength range. Additionally, the IMO: H ﬁlms were also proven to possess lower rc with mc-Si:H(n). Besides the PCEs, the total cost of SHJ solar cell is also a critical obstacle to industrialization. Beneﬁting the uniquely indispensable TCO layers in SHJ, a low-temperatureesintering metal paste could be used, providing the possibility to reduce the cost by using scarce materials. Silver in the grid electrodes is going to be reduced or replaced by a base metal, such as Cu@Ag core-shell materials [155] or Cu with surface oxidation resistance [156]. Until 2021, the costs of TCO targets are still an important factor, which spend more than 10% of the consumable costs [7]. The main reason is the relatively high price of indium [26]. Hence, indium-free TCO materials, such as AZO [112,145], are also attempted to integrate into the SHJ solar cells. Compared with ITO, stability veriﬁed by industry and academia, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance since the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved issue. AZO ﬁlms still face challenges of relatively high resistivity [157,158]. Another possible approach would be using multilayered AR coatings such as SiOx [24], SiNx [118,119], and MgF2 [117] on top of extremely thin ITO layers. In this way, the usage of indium could be reduced while still maintaining low resistivity contact. For example, SHJ solar cells have the potential to achieve an excellent Jsc beyond 42 mA/cm2 if the front-side ITO layer can be replaced by an ITO/SiNx double layer [118,119]. 5. Summary and perspective Herein, we presented a comprehensive review covering all the aspects of TCO ﬁlms in the application of SHJ solar cells, from basic functions to materials, as well as their application in mass production. SHJ solar cells are a fundamental approach for accomplishing high-efﬁciency PV devices. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms act as literal conductive layers which connect the doped a-/mc-Si:H layers and the metal grids. As a fundamental role in the solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms have a key impact on PCEs and the production cost of the solar cell intensively. ITO materials are still the most widely applied TCOs in SHJ solar cells in mass production. But their relatively low carrier mobility of less than 40 cm/(Vs) is becoming a limiting factor to meet the continuous demand for elevating solar cell performance. Meanwhile, the high indium consumption of ITO ﬁlms hinders further reducing the production cost. Therefore, TCO materials, deposition techniques as well as PVD equipment should be further investigated for SHJ solar cells to enhance the performance and mitigate the cost. Here, we outline possible research approaches and challenges that have to be addressed for the future development of TCO ﬁlms. Development of high-mobility TCOs. In TCO ﬁlms, it is a tradeoff between the conductivity and the transparency via tuning Ne. While with the improvement of m, the conductivity of TCO ﬁlms could be enhanced without any losses in transmittance. Hence, the development of high-mobility (>100 cm2/(Vs)) TCO materials is highly required for the mass production of SHJ solar cells. Application of multilayered TCO structures. To deduct the rc of the TCO/doped a-Si:H and the TCO/Ag grid interfaces, the materials composite from the front to the rear side of TCO ﬁlms should be different. Consequently, multilayer structures, in which materials with different WFs or Ne, should be applied in TCO ﬁlms. Low-damage TCO coating methods. The PVD coating methods and processes to fabricate TCO ﬁlms play a signiﬁcant role on the passivation effect of the substrates. Therefore, the development of low-damage TCO coating equipment or processes that are suitable for mass production is indispensable for improving cell efﬁciency. Reduction of indium consumption. The high indium consumption of TCO ﬁlms is one of the detrimental factors that hinders the cost reduction of SHJ solar cells. To deduct the indium consumption or develop indium-free TCO ﬁlms, it is highly required to apply in SHJ solar cells. Meanwhile, the technique of deposition of an ARC on top of the TCO ﬁlms, which means shrinking the thickness of TCO ﬁlms, also should be applied in solar cells. Silicon solar cells can be manufactured, even at the TW scale, where the photoactive bulk silicon layer avoids any scarce materials, and the silver grid electrode is going to be substituted by base metals, such as copper. SHJ solar cells are going to be the predominant production in the market of Si-based PV devices in the future. As the key cost issues for the SHJ devices, the development of TCO ﬁlms still faces some challenges. We believe this review would prompt us to learn the achievements, remaining challenges, as well as possible investigation directions, and promote the development of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells rapidly.

Over the past decades, crystal silicon (c-Si) is still the dominant material for photovoltaic manufacture, beneﬁting from its nearly ideal optical bandgap, abundant, and mature semiconductor technology.

Introduction The world market of photovoltaics (PV) is currently dominated by crystal silicon (c-Si)-based solar cells, which occupy a market share of approximately 95% in 2019 [1,2]. Amongst c-Si solar cells, aluminum back surface ﬁeld (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells (Fig. 1a), which are also named by homojunction c-Si solar cells, are predominating in large-scale industrial solar cell products (Fig. 1b). However, due to the high carrier recombination at the silicon surface, the values of the power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of Al-BSF cells and PERC cells are reaching their limitation, which are around 20% and 24% [3], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. Besides, the polysilicon-passivated junction technique, built by embedding a thin silicon oxide layer atop a c-Si substrate, also named tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), is emerging as a promising alternative. And a record PCE of 26.4% [4] has been achieved in TOPCon cells. As an alternative, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technique is an important approach for the next generation of highefﬁciency PV productions [1,6,7], as predicted in Fig. 1d. In the 1990s, Sanyo Co. invented the ﬁrst SHJ solar cell, which integrated a boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter with an n-type c-Si wafer and achieved a PCE close to 12% [8]. And then Sanyo Co. improved the PCE to 22.8% [9] and 23.7% [10] in 2009 and 2011, respectively, in which the carrier concentration of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms was reduced to mitigate free carrier absorption (FCA), while the Hall mobility was improved to optimize the lateral conductivity. In 2013, they further enhanced the PCE to 24.7% [11]. And then, the PCE of double-side SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% [12] on a large area device of 151.9 cm2 by Kaneka Co. in 2015 due to high ﬁll factor (FF) of 83%.

All rights reserved. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 SHJ solar cells to reduce the parasitic absorption from the a-Si:H and TCO layers, resulting in a record PCE of 26.7% [13] in 2017. In 2022, SHJ solar cells based on transition metal doped indium oxide (IMO) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (m-Si:H) achieved a PCE of 25.26% [14]. And in the same year, Longi Co. raised the world-record PCE to 26.81% [15] for SHJ solar cells, approaching the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [16]. In recent years, several industry players joined the SHJ solar cell market. As predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic [2], SHJ cells are expected to gain a market share of about 10% in 2025, corresponding to a shipment of over 100 GW per year. In future mass manufacture, due to the relatively low temperatures in fabrication processes, SHJ solar cells can tolerate continually thinner c-Si thickness (up to 80 mm), which would exactly cater to the cost reduction for the PV industry. Due to the poor lateral conductivity of the doped a-Si:H layers in SHJ solar cells, the front and rear sides of the devices must be combined with transparent electrode layers to deliver the photogenerated charges to the terminals. Amongst all the materials for the transparent electrodes, TCOs are ideal candidates to meet the requirement. TCOs are intrinsically wide band-gap materials, typically metal oxides, that can be heavily doped and serve as transparent conductors for charge carrier extraction at the device terminals [17e22]. Since the 1960s and 1970s, TCOs have witnessed the revolutionary development of SHJ solar cells due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties [23e26]. Existing reviews on this topic either emphasize all aspects of SHJ solar cells or are out of date [1,7,27e29]. In other works, researchers reviewed the achievements and the challenges of TCO ﬁlms [30e32]. As TCOs are fundamental materials for SHJ solar cells, a systematic review of material selection, characterization, and gigawatt-scale production is essential but still lacking. This article reviews the general requirements and the status of the development of TCO ﬁlms targeting high-performance SHJ solar cells. In the ﬁrst section, we listed and discussed the relevant properties of TCO ﬁlms for the application in SHJ solar cells, including conductivity, transparency as well as contact resistance at the interfaces. Additionally, we also elucidated the inﬂuence factors and the control strategies for the passivation detrimental effect during the deposition of TCO ﬁlms. In the second section, we summarized the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells, focusing on their inﬂuence on work function (WF), resistivity, and transmittance on the performance of SHJ solar cells. In the third section, we presented the current state and developing trend of TCO ﬁlms in the industrialization of SHJ solar cells. 2. Application requirements of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells 2.1. Transparency, reﬂectance, and conductivity of TCO ﬁlms In SHJ solar cells, both optical and electrical properties are signiﬁcant for TCO ﬁlms. However, there is always a trade-off between these two properties. The improvement of the transparency of the Fig. 1.

(d) The schematic of silicon heterojunction solar cells. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 2 TCO ﬁlms always leads to the reduction of the conductivity, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the optical and electrical properties of TCO ﬁlms to achieve desirable performance in SHJ solar cells. As bifacial devices, the performance of SHJ solar cells is primarily inﬂuenced by the optical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, including transparency and antireﬂection (AR) properties, at both the front and rear sides. The transparency of the TCO ﬁlms is mainly determined by the band structure and the deposition condition [33]. For application in SHJ solar cells, the material should possess decent transmittance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. For this reason, typical metal oxides with a fundamental bandgap larger than 3 eV [33,34], including indium oxide (In2O3) [35], tin oxide (SnO2) [36,37], and zinc oxide (ZnO) [35,38], are widely applied in TCO ﬁlms. To improve their conductivity, the metal oxides are doped by other elements to shift the Fermi level into the conduction band, during which the free carrier concentration (Ne) in the oxides is improved. The transmittance toward the long wavelength region is tremendously affected by Ne. According to Drude theory, the plasma frequency u could be written as Equation (1) [39,40]: u2 ¼ e2$Ne ε0$εr$m* (1) where, e is the electric charge carried by a single electron, and ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. The plasma frequency deﬁned the onset of the FCA, thus the increase of Ne would reduce the transmittance of the TCO ﬁlms at a long wavelength range. Generally, TCO ﬁlms also act the role of AR coatings, which determines the thickness of the ﬁlms. The reﬂectance on the Si surface is minimized for one wavelength, which is given by Ref. [33]: dTCO ¼ l 4n (2) where, l is the wavelength at which the reﬂectance is minimized, n is the refractive index of the TCO ﬁlms at the wavelength, and dTCO is the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. Generally, to achieve the best PCE performance, the solar cell should present the lowest reﬂectance at the visible light range (400e760 nm), which determines the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. For example, for indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlms on the front side of the SHJ solar cells, the thickness is generally set at 70e80 nm since ITO exhibits an n of approximately 1.9 at the wavelength of 580 nm [41]. For the TCO ﬁlms on the rear sides, the thickness could be a bit larger to mitigate the sheet resistance (Rsheet) at the cost of reducing the PCE measured at the rear side (for bifacial cells). In SHJ solar cells, the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms determines the pitch of the metal grids. A decrease of Rsheet allows a larger pitch of the metal grid, which then beneﬁts the cell performance by reducing themetal shading area as well as improving lateral transportation. Since Rsheet is deﬁned as Rsheet ¼ r/dTCO, either reducing electrical resistivity (r) or accumulating dTCO enables Rsheet smaller. However, as discussed above, dTCO is determined mainly by the antireﬂectance performance. In the TCO ﬁlms, the relationships among resistivity r, Ne, and the carrier mobility (m) could be described as Equation (3) [42], r ¼ 1 eNem (3) Either the improvement of Ne or m leads to a decrease in r, which further reduces Rsheet and improves FF in solar cells. Most TCO materials are n-type semiconductors, and Ne of their ﬁlms is primarily determined by the dopant concentration in the host materials. Besides, Ne could also be tuned by deposition conditions, such as deposition power [43], the pressure of the chamber [44], partial pressure of oxygen [45e47] and water [48,49] etc, which results in a value of Ne in the range from 1019 to 1021 cm3 [50]. Since the increase of Ne degrades the transparency of the TCO ﬁlms in the visible and near-infrared region, the best strategy to reduce Rsheet is to increase m while limiting Ne. The m in n-type materials could be written as Equation (4) [33,51], m ¼ et m* (4) where, t is the relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band, respectively. Different scattering mechanisms caused by ionized impurities, neutral impurities, or gain boundaries have an impact on the relaxation time of the carriers in the TCO ﬁlms and decrease m [33,51]. For the ITO ﬁlms applied in SHJ solar cells, typical motilities are 20e40 cm2/(V$s) [35,52]. Therefore, as the aspect of the solar cell performance, it is a trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. The increase of Ne leads to an improvement in conductivity but a reduction in transparency, while the decrease results in a contrary result. To balance the optical and the electrical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, the ﬁgure of merit (FTC) is intruded to evaluate the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms on solar cell performance, which is deﬁned as Equation (5) [53]: FTC ¼ T10 avg Rsheet (5) With the Tavg the average of the transmittance of the ﬁlms. The larger FTC means a better compromise between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms, which leads to better performance of the solar cells. 2.2. Carrier transportation at TCO interfaces In the structure of SHJ solar cells, TCO ﬁlms connect the carrier selective layers and the metal electrodes, enabling the TCO ﬁlms important roles in carrier transportation at the interfaces. Amongst all the interfaces in SHJ solar cells, the carrier transportation at the TCO/doped a-Si:H interfaces has a critical contribution to the series resistivity losses [54,55]. To study the contact resistivity (rc) at the interfaces, the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts are generally considered as Schottky contacts, in which the carrier transportation is typically governed by the energy band alignment [56,57]. According to simulation results, the WF difference between the TCO ﬁlm and the a-Si:H layer has a strong inﬂuence on the contact resistance [58,59]. That means the WF requirements for the TCO ﬁlms of the electron contact (TCO/a-Si(n)) and the hole contact (TCO/a-Si(p)) are different. As reported by Ritzau et al. [56], as shown in Fig. 2a, for the ideal electron contacts, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be lower than 4.2 eV, which is close to the Fermi level of the a-Si:H(n) layers. While for the hole contacts at the TCO/a-Si:H(p) interfaces, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be higher than that of the a-Si:H(p) layers (~5.3 eV) [60]. However, the TCO materials applied in SHJ solar cells are typically n-type semiconductors with relatively low WFs, such as ITO (4.2e4.5eV) [36,37], aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) (3.4e4.5eV) [61], etc, which do not meet the requirements for the hole contacts. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the patterns with the aSi:H(p)/ITO or a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact exhibit lower open circuit voltages (VOCs) at high illumination intensity than the ones with a W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 3 high WF WOx layer, conﬁrming that large Schottky barriers are formed in the former contacts and hinder carrier transportation at the interfaces. To suppress rc of the hole contacts, high WF transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxides (MoOx) [61e63], tungsten oxides (WOx) [61,64,65], and vanadium oxides (VOx) [66], are integrated into SHJ solar cells as contact modiﬁcation layers. Regarding the a-Si:H(p) layers, a sufﬁciently high net doping concentration is necessary to optimize rc by avoiding the hole-selective layer from being depleted [55,67,68]. But the rising of the doping concentration burdens the defect densities in the a-Si:H layers [69,70], ﬁxing the effective net doping at a level below 1017 cm3. To realize this strategy, doped hydrogenated nano- or microcrystalSi (nc-Si:H [68,71] or mc-Si:H [14]) layers, in which the effective net doping level could be higher than 1019 cm3, are integrated into SHJ solar cells, alternating the doped a-Si:H layers. Zhao et al. reported SHJ solar cells with the nc-Si:H(p)/ITO contact and achieved low contact resistance (rc of 0.144 U,cm2) successfully [72]. As discussed above, the traditional transportation exploration at the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts is mainly based on direct tunneling (DT), which is highly dependent on energy alignment. While in recent works, besides the DT mode, indirect tunneling (IDT) modes, such as trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and band-to-band tunneling (B2BT), are taken into consideration as well in the simulation of charge carrier transportation at the hole and the electron contacts in SHJ solar cell. Fig. 3a and b show typical carrier transport processes based on the DT and IDT modes at the n- and the p-contact. At the n-contact, the carrier transportation is primarily dominated by the DT mode and supported by TAT mode partially. While at the p-contact, the IDT mode is the dominant one instead of the DT mode. Regarding carrier transportation by either DT or IDT, the charge Ne of TCO ﬁlms plays an important role. On the one hand, the increase of Ne leads to the decrease of the WFs of TCO ﬁlms [73], which beneﬁts DT at the electron contact but deteriorates the WF mismatch at the hole contact. On the other hand, larger Ne is beneﬁcial for IDT on both sides of the solar cells [70,73,74]. Therefore, large Ne in TCO ﬁlms is helpful to maintain low rc at the electron contact areas. While for the hole contacts, due to the WF mismatch, the carrier transportation at the interfaces is primarily determined by IDT but is also impacted by the energy alignment. So, appropriate Ne of the ITO ﬁlms is required for the hole contacts with small rc. In Fig. 3c, rc for the hole contacts is plotted against Ne of the TCO ﬁlms [70]. At the active energy (Ea) of the a-Si:H(p) layer at 275 meV, the lowest rc is located at Ne value of approximately 2 1020 cm3. When the Ne rises above this value, the rc slightly increases due to the WF mismatch, while the rc rises monotonically with the reducing Ne below 2 1020 cm3. The TCO/metal contacts on both sides of the SHJ solar cells are another important factor that should be taken into consideration. In the manufacture of SHJ solar cells, screen printing with lowtemperature sintering metal pastes is the most widely applied technique for metallization. During this process, silver (Ag) or silver-coated copper (Ag@Cu) pastes are printed on the TCO surfaces, and metal grid electrodes are formed after drying and sintering processes with temperatures less than 200 C. Generally, the rc of the TCO/silver grid contacts (rc, TCO/Ag) is primarily dominated by the Ne in TCO ﬁlms [75]. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO/metal contacts are always treated as Schottky contacts [75]. As a highly doped semiconductor (Ne > 1019 cm3), ﬁeld emission (FE) or thermionic ﬁeld emission (TFE) is the dominant transportation mode at the contact [75,76]. According to the Schottky metal/semiconductor junction theory, an increase in Ne in TCO ﬁlms leads to a thinner potential barrier at the TCO/metal interfaces. Hence, the chance of charge carrier tunneling through the barriers should be enhanced, and rc,TCO/Ag is reduced accordingly. As shown in Fig. 3d, Schube et al. proved that rc,ITO/Ag decreases with the increase of Ne in the ITO layers under similar printing and sintering conditions [77]. 2.3. Degradation of passivation during deposition of TCO ﬁlms In recent years, deposition techniques with less damage impact on the a-Si:H layers, such as reactive plasma deposition (RPD) [78], atom layer deposition (ALD) [79e81], and sputtering with mirror shape target conﬁguration [82,83], have been investigated to fabricate TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells. However, conventional pulsed or direct current magnetron sputtering is still the most widely used deposition technique in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, owing to their high deposition rates and scalability. During the sputtering of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated silicon substrate interacts withthe plasma intensively, and a signiﬁcant degradation occurs in the passivation interfaces, leading to a reduction of VOC and pseudo-FF in the solar cell performance [84]. The detrimental effect during sputtering primarily arises from ultraviolet (UV) light luminescence [85,86] in plasma and ion bombardment [87,88], including ion and neutral particles from plasma gas, sputtering targets, and their compounds [89]. And the passivation quality could be partially recovered after a high-temperature treatment during or after the TCO deposition process [84,86]. UV radiation is believed as a damage source for the a-Si: H passivation in SHJ solar cells for a long time [85,90,91]. During the deposition processes of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated Si substrates are under the illumination of plasma and damage occurs in the a-Si:H ﬁlms or at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces. In a-Si:H ﬁlms, the Fig. 2. (a) The simulated ﬁll factor as a function of the work function and a-Si:H doping (n/p type) [56]. (b) Patterns of Suns-VOC measurements (open circuit voltages measured with different illumination) of the p-contact at high illumination intensity (the inset is the respective structure in the measurements) [56].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 4 binding energy of SieH and SieSi is approximately 3.6 eV [92] and 2.5 eV [93], respectively, which is in the UVevisible spectral range. After the illumination of UV light in plasma, the SieSi and the SieH bonds in a-Si:H(i) or a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are partially broken and then the passivation effect of the Si substrates is degraded [86]. B. Demaurex et al. show that the minority carrier lifetime (MCLT) of the a-Si:H passivated Si samples shielded with normal glasses (10% transparency at 4.7 eV) and quartz glasses (10% transparency at 7.8 eV) dropped 14% and 27% after sputtering, respectively, comparing with a value of 96% on bare samples without shielding [86]. It has been proven that the damage should be ascribed to plasma luminescence. During the plasma illuminating process, the surface recombination velocity of the samples would be degraded after a short exposure of 10 s and reach a saturation value after ~60 s [87]. It was interpreted that the UV light triggers the generation of fast metastable defects at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface in several seconds, and the reversible defects become saturated in a minute. Ion bombardment is the most critical part of the detrimental effects. During deposition, the MCLT losses of the passivated Si wafer could be more than 90%, as compared with that before deposition [43,84,86,94]. And merely part of the losses could be recovered after annealing. Generally, the detrimental effects of the particle bombardment are correlated with the thickness of the a-Si: H layer [95], the deposition conditions [89,96] as well as the deposition modes [84,97,98]. The a-Si:H layer with enough thickness enables the protection of the silicon wafer from any damage caused by bombardment during sputtering. However, due to the parasitic absorption [52] and the high resistive property [55,74], the increase of the a-Si:H layer can signiﬁcantly contribute to optical and series resistance losses in solar cells. As reported by L. Tutsch et al., the MCLTs of the wafers passivated with >7-nm-thick aSi:H(i) layers are almost fully restored after sputtering and after sputtering annealing, while the samples with 7-nm-thick passivation layers exhibit severe detrimental effects [95]. It is consistent with the thickness of a-Si:H stacks in SHJ solar cells, which lies approximately 10 nm [14]. Regarding deposition conditions, the degradation induced by ion bombardment could be suppressed by either decreasing the power applied to the targets or increasing the chamber pressure during sputtering [95]. The passivation degradation caused by ion bombardment should be correlated with either ion kinetic energy [99,100] or ion ﬂux [86,87]. Reduction of the power leads to a decrease of the current and voltage on the target, thereby lowing both the ion ﬂux and ion kinetic energy in the plasma deposition process [95]. On the other hand, the improvement of the chamber Fig. 3. The schematic band diagrams and carrier transport mechanisms for (a) the n-contact and (b) the p-contact [73].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 5 pressure increases the possibility of being scattered on their way toward the substrate, which then reduces the kinetic energy and the damage of bombardment [95]. L. Tutsch et al. utilized a thin ITO ﬁlm of several nanometers, which was deposited with relatively low power and high chamber pressure to protect the a-Si:H(i) layers-passivated Si wafer from the damage of ion bombardment [43]. As a result, the lifetime of the protected samples was improved by several folds, and their iVoc was enhanced for ~26 mV in comparison with the baseline samples. The comparison of passivation degradation among different sputtering modes, including radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), and pulsed DC modes, was summarized [84,97,98]. Due to the lower target voltage (RF: 112 V, DC: >200 V), RF sputtering exhibits less bombardmentinduced damage to the passivated substrates both after sputtering and recovering after annealing. Regardless of the damage sources in the TCO deposition process, the a-Si:H-based surface passivation can be recovered by 180e200 C thermal annealing either during or after the deposition [87,101,102]. During the thermal treatment process, the carrier concentration at the c-Si surface (band bending) would be tuned. It was reported that the surface defects in a-Si:H passivation layers can be eliminated after annealing at 180 C [101]. This effect is due to the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the a-Si:H(i) bulk toward dangling bonds at the c-Si surface, and the latter is then passivated by the formation of monohydrides. It is likely that the repassivation of dangling bonds, caused by the sputter-induced SieH bond rupture, follows the same principles. As reported by Demaurex et al. [86], the microstructural modiﬁcation in the a-Si:H layers after sputtering and annealing was investigated by a Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement. In this report, the authors showed that both monohydride and multihydride bonds in the a-Si:H layers were descended after sputtering, while the hydride bonds recovered partially after short annealing. 3. Classiﬁcation of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells Due to its superior photoelectric property and long-term stability, ITO is widely used in optoelectronic applications and has become the standard material for SHJ solar cells [1,7]. Meanwhile, the optoelectrical performance can be further improved by tuning the composition or interface modiﬁcation. To reduce the use of the rare indium element, it is an attractive way to ﬁnd low-cost substitutes with indium-based TCOs. AZO is a natively polycrystalline material with lower electronic quality than ITO when deposited at low temperatures (<200 C) and as a thin layer (<100 nm), making it an attractive low-cost substitute [31,103]. Indium-based oxides [45,98,104e108] and zinc-based oxides [109e115] are the most widely studied two TCO categories in SHJ solar cells. Each of them has its limitations. In this section, we attempt to review the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells and their performance in SHJ solar cells. 3.1. Doped indium oxides In recent years, indium-based TCOs have attracted wide attention and been reviewed, thanks to their high conductivity to ensure the transportation of photogenerated charges as well as outstanding transparency to the sun spectrum [19]. Despite the limited indium content in the earth's crust, various cation-doped In2O3 have been investigated so far in SHJ solar cells [24,25]. Indium oxide doped with hydrogen, tin, tungsten, cerium, etc. are commonly used TCO materials in SHJ cells. In the following part, roadmaps toward higher efﬁciency by using indium-based oxides as TCOs in SHJ solar cells would be discussed. 3.1.1. ITO Currently, more than 70% of indium is used in the production of ITO materials, which subsequently has broadly been applied as TCO ﬁlms in the production of industrial SHJ solar cells [24,25]. The relatively low resistivity, high transparency, and large-scale production capability make ITO well-suited for displaying the transport channel layer on both sides in SHJ solar cells. Additionally, long-time stability and facile production are other factors to contribute ITO as the dominant TCO electrodes. Consequently, continuous improvements in industrial PCE performance have been obtained, and the breakthrough efﬁciency of double-side contacted SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% in 2015 [12], a world record, surpassing the champion efﬁciency of homojunction PERC cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Kaneka Corp. published their work on IBCSHJ (structure as Fig. 4b) with the ﬁrst silicon solar cell exceeding a PCE of 26% with a FF of 83.8% [24]. Later in 2017, further progress in eliminating the parasitic absorption of a-Si:H layers by using IBC structures was reported to be a PCE of 26.7% [13]. A world-record PCE of 26.81% is achieved by LONGI Co. in 2022. However, compared with the theoretical PCE limit (close to the 28.5% theoretical ceiling predicted for a 1.1 eV band gap material), there is still a noticeable gap for the further development of ITO in SHJ solar cells in the coming years. Most notably, the PCE of current SHJ devices is limited by the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. Due to the relatively low carrier mobility, which is generally below 40 cm2/(Vs), ITO ﬁlms are not able to achieve high transparency and decent conductivity at the same time [1,21,24,117]. That tradeoff limits the improvement of the solar cell PCE. Moreover, the strategies of pattern processing structures or multilayer reﬂectors have been reported that do not balance the conﬂicting optical and electrical properties of ITO in SHJ devices [24,117e119], but any additional layers and processes might burden the cost and complexity for the cell fabrication process. Thus, the approach for developing new TCOs with high carrier mobility and low extinction coefﬁcient is necessary. 3.1.2. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) By alternating tin in ITO materials with hydrogen to form hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H), a high m of 100 cm2/(Vs) has been achieved. The IO:H ﬁlms exhibit extremely low solar-average absorption, coming in as one of the most ideal materials to replace ITO at the front side (Fig. 5a) [39,55,120,121e124]. By replacing the front ITO layer with IO:H, Koida et al. demonstrated a PCE of 16.1% for the SHJ solar cells [122]. A large-scale (153.4 cm2) device with a PCE of 21.13% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.18 mA/cm2 was exhibited, showing an obvious enhancement compared to the ITO counterparts (Fig. 5b) [125]. Indeed, the incorporation of the IO:H ﬁlms, instead of the conventional ITO ﬁlms, enhances the Jsc and the resulting PCE. The detailed analysis of the solar cells revealed that the appearance of hydrogen atoms as single-charged donors and their ability to passivate defects at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline ﬁlms led to the reduction of reﬂection loss at the IO:H/a-Si:H interface and less optical absorption in the IO:H layers [39,120,123,124]. Compared with ITO and IZO ﬁlms, the resulting IO:H ﬁlms feature both high carrier mobility (with the best value of 100 cm2/V$s) and large band gap values after annealing, which contribute to the Jsc of 39.18 mA/cm2 [125]. Compared with the ITO materials, IO:H suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the metal front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting an ITO layer between IO:H and Ag [120]. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, low Rsheet as well as small free-carrier absorption, outperforming the IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells (Fig. 5c) [120]. A remarkable PCE of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen- W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 6 printed SHJ solar cell was obtained by employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide. Nevertheless, copper plating was also investigated to reduce the expensive silver usage. A certiﬁed solar cell device with a PCE of 22.5% (FF of 80%) is demonstrated utilizing the combination of a-Si:H/MoOx, layers, IO:H ﬁlms, and copper-plated grids (Fig. 5d) [126]. These results demonstrate that IO:H is quite an attractive alternative to ITO for SHJ solar cells. 3.1.3. Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), the substitution of W6þ for In3þ, is a kind of TCO ﬁlm that can provide more carriers while reducing the defect concentration, compared to ITO ﬁlms [127]. IWO ﬁlms show high carrier mobility values of 50e80 cm2/(Vs) [19]. Beneﬁting from their high electron mobility, IWO layers not only yield low resistivity but also show high NIR transmittance (94.21% at a 80 nm thickness). Moreover, there are many Fig. 4.

Due to the high carrier mobility, IWO materials are integrated into SHJ solar cells as transparent electrode layers on both the front and the rear sides, reducing both Rsheet and FCA and leading to improved performances in the solar cells (Fig. 6a). In the early stage, to obtain appropriate carrier mobility above 60 cm2/(Vs), the deposition temperature was higher than 300 C for a long time [128]. However, this is contrary to the low process temperature requirement of SHJ solar cells. Subsequently, a series of low-temperature technologies were reported to adapt the application environment for SHJ solar cells, such as low-damage RPD or room-temperature sputtering technology [1,127e132]. Consequently, improved performances were achieved for the IWO-based SHJ solar cells to exceed 20% (Table 1). With the application of high-performance titanium and tungsten co-doped indium oxide ﬁlms, large-scale SHJ solar cells (243.34 cm2) with a high average PCE of 23.8% (with a Voc of 0.746 V, a Jsc of 38.7 mA/ cm2 and FF of 82.9%) were fabricated, in which the PCE was still lower than that for the record ITO-based SHJ solar cells yet [133]. Similar to the a-Si:H/ITO interface, the a-Si:H/IWO interfacial contact is also one of the crucial factors limiting the PCEs of the SHJ solar cells. A series of strategies are applied to optimize the Schottky barrier between p-a-Si:H and IWO. One approach is to apply MgF2 as a double-layer AR coating on top of the optimal device, the EQEintegrated Jsc was improved from 39.41 mA/cm2 to 40.16 mA/cm2 [128]. The ﬁnal 8.97-cm2 wide IWO/MgF2-based solar cell showed an active area cell efﬁciency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efﬁciency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b, Table 1) [128]. Additionally, the H diffusion from a-Si:H to tungsten-doped indium (IWOH) is reported to not only reduce the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms but also optimize the interfaces of a-Si:H/IWO [130]. The improved PCE of 22.3% for the IWOH-based solar cells was achieved on an average for 4cm2 SHJ cells, which have higher Jsc and PCEs than the IWO-based solar cell and similar FF [130]. Further, the prolonged hydrogen annealing process for the IWO-based solar cells gained the PCE by 1.14% to 23.31%, with a device area of 244.5 cm2 [129]. The aspect of electrical and optical properties, IWO is a desirable material for industrial SHJ solar cells, especially in solar cells with low-cost copper conductor grids [138]. A SHJ solar cell with copper as the metal grids and IWO as the transparent electrodes, which are fabricated in the lab and SIMIT's R&D line, reached a PCE of over 22%, showing great potential for the copper metallization of the SHJ solar cells with reduced cost and overcoming the limitations of screen-printing technology (Fig. 6c) [131]. By now, there is a consensus within the industrialization of IWO that the content of indium in the excellent performance of IWO (In:W ¼ 95:5) is still insufﬁciently ideal [128,129,137,133], where the high production costs would the pressing issue. In a word, IWO can provide advantages over ITO due to its lower absorption in the long wavelength region. However, there is still room for further improvement in conversion efﬁciency. Fig. 6.

Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 8 3.1.4. Alternative doped indium oxide To date, there are indium-based TCOs with other doping metals such as cerium, titanium, and zirconium, which mainly perform as front transparent electrodes for the solar cells having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region [78,125,139e141]. The large potential of the optimally processed In2O3:Ce:H (ICO:H) window layers in SHJ cells is demonstrated, quantiﬁed by the improvement in Jsc of 0.6 mA/cm2 without impairing the resistive losses in comparison to the usage of baseline ITO layers [139]. By further incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional ITO and IO:H ﬁlms, an improved PCE of 24.1%, a Voc of 745 mV, a Jsc of 38.8 mA/ cm2, and a FF of 83.2% were obtained [78]. It is believed that their high carrier mobility of 140 cm2/(V$s) contributed to their high efﬁciency. Already, SHJ solar cells with the optimized indium zirconium oxide (IZrO) front electrodes resulted in a Jsc of 40 mA/cm2, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 23.4% [141]. A heterojunction solar cell with an ITO/IZrO bilayer electrode succeeds in a Jsc of 38.72 mA/ cm2, a FF of 82.39%, and a PCE of up to 23.59% [140]. Similarly, the signiﬁcant reduction of the reﬂection loss of the conventional and needle-like Hf-doped In2O3 (IHFO) bilayer ﬁlms deposited on the textured silicon was observed. The short-circuit current and efﬁciency of the solar cell were improved by 0.52 mA/cm2 and 0.39%, utilizing a needle-like IHFO thin ﬁlm as an AR layer [134]. As for the manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells increases or future tandem devices, there are signiﬁcant concerns about the use of indium. The values of indium consumption per cell and per generated power for SHJ solar cells from different sources exhibited large discrepancies, but all available data indicate concern about the insufﬁcient supply of indium to support in the future [25]. Signiﬁcantly, reducing indium consumption for TCO ﬁlms has become mandatory to push SHJ solar cell technology toward a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. As an alternative to minimizing the use of metallic indium, thin indiumbased TCOs (with better performance) or the IBC cell design might be a choice. With a reduced thickness of approximately 30 nm for ITO layers, the resource-sustainable manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells would be substantially increased to 115e330 GW. However, this would only account for approximately 5e10% of a 3 TW market size, suggesting that the SHJ solar cell using ITO in some form remains a niche product. Moreover, reducing the thickness of ITO layers could also lead to signiﬁcant increases in rc due to the changes in current pathways and the current crowding effect. For example, 20-nm-thick ITO capped by a non-indiumbased TCO would greatly increase the sustainable manufacturing capacity compared to the present implementation for SHJ solar cells relying solely on ITO [25]. Thus, substituting part or full of ITO with a more transparent and less expensive dielectric indium-free ﬁlm is promising. 3.2. Doped zinc oxide Typically, an approximately 70-nm-thick ITO layer is used on each surface to form thin transparent conductive layers at the front and rear of the SHJ solar cells, corresponding to approximately 5.7 mg/W consumption of ITO and 4.2 mg/W consumption of indium, with an assumed cell PCE of 25.11% [25]. Thus, the future of cSi PVs would beneﬁt greatly from any alternative indium-free layer to circumvent the parasitic absorption in TCOs. As for the choice of indium-free TCOs in SHJ, AZOs, with low cost, abundant material reserves in nature and capability of achieving comparable efﬁciencies to the ITO-based SHJ solar cells, has been considered as one of the few potential alternatives to ITOs [109,142]. To reduce the use of indium, both ITO 50%/AZO 50% and ITO 25%/ AZO 50%/ITO 25% were used on the back of SHJ solar cells with a decent performance, which was close to that of individual ITO (Fig. 7a) [114]. The performance of the SHJ solar cells with such two kinds of TCO stacks as the back TCO layers was greatly improved compared to that with the individual AZO layer [114]. Meanwhile, the PCE gap between such the ITO/AZO stacks and the individual ITO stack could be narrowed to approximately 0.1% (absolute value), showing the possibility of applying the ITO/AZO stack structure in the SHJ solar cell [114]. Considering the use of indium-free TCOs, the AZO layers were used in three different cell conﬁgurations labeled as ‘front-AZO cell’, ‘back-AZO cell’. and ‘all-AZO cell’ [144]. At the early stage, it was found that the PCE was challenging to exceed 20% for the SHJ solar cells with the direct application of the individual AZO ﬁlm as a front-AZO cell (Table 2) [109,142]. For further improving the light coupling by textured AZO or the implementation of the electrochemically grown ZnO nanorod as AR layers on AZO, less discernible enhancement of the PCE was observed (Fig. 7b) [142]. Thanks to the optimization of experimental conditions for AZO, the abovementioned front AZO cell showed an overall increasing PCE of over 20% [143]. The low PCE was attributed to the poor contact of aSi:H(p)/AZO and the low electrical and optical properties of AZO. The optimized low-resistivity a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact by the implementation of a trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) doped a-Si:H(p) ﬁlm as a hole transport layer enables a FF above 81% and a PCE of 23.6% for the front-AZO SHJ solar cells, comparable with 23.7%-efﬁcient cells using traditional ITO (Fig. 7c) [143]. In addition, the back-AZO cell experienced a similar performance improvement path as that of the front-AZO cell. Featuring a standard screen-printed silver grid at the front with approximately 3.25% optical shadowing, a champion device of the black-AZO cell a Jsc of up to 40.81 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 23.96% was obtained [112]. As for all-AZO cells, a 4-cm2 cell was certiﬁed at ISFH CalTec with an efﬁciency of 23.0%, a VOC of 738.8 mV, a FF of 80.3%, and a JSC of 38.7 mA/cm2 [145].

W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 9 Furthermore, an all-AZO cell with a 244 cm2 total area reached a PCE as high as 21.3% by using an amorphous silicon oxide layer (aSiO2) as an AR coating. Thus far, AZO appeared to be a promising indium-free alternative material to replace the back ITO commonly used in SHJ solar cells. Remarkably, the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved problem [113,145]. Signiﬁcantly increasing electrical resistivity and surface degradation were obtained, when the AZO is exposed to a harsh environment (e.g. annealing in the air or humidity damping). Damp heat test results of encapsulated SHJ devices with AZO as the TCO ﬁlms exhibited relative FF degradation of 7% after 1000 h [145]. This drawback prevents AZO ﬁlms to be deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices. Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of effort still needs to be put into battle with the relatively poor conductivity and long-term stability of AZO layers. For example, the FF degradation rate might reduce with the deposition of a-SiO2 or SiNx under humid conditions [145]. However, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance. 3.3. Other TCOs Alternatively, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and graphene have also attracted attention [146e151]. Ag NWselectrodes can be deposited on top of the SHJ structure by mechanical transfer or solution technologies while achieving excellent transmittance and conductivity. However, Ag was reported to maintain low contact resistance between the silicon layer and metal, but it could easily react with a thin-ﬁlm silicon layer to form an insulating layer of AgO that blocks charge extraction. The issues remain to be tackled in the other metal-based TCOs, such as Ti, Cu, et al. [23] By inserting a SiNx layer to suppress the deterioration of the passivation quality of the Ti layer induced by direct metal-to-a-Si:H contacts, an indium-free design for SHJ solar cells achieve low series resistivity, a decent FF (80.7%), and efﬁciencies (>22%) [118]. Regarding graphene-based TCOs, until now, it is still arguable for use as a transparent electrode for any solar cell, since it would absorb signiﬁcantly over the full spectrum and shows large Rsheet [147]. 4. TCO ﬁlms for practical applications In mass production, rear-emitter (RE) structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n)/TCO/metal) are nowadays widely applied in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, taking the place of the traditional front emitter structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/TCO/metal) [7,14,152]. As discussed above , it is a trade-off between lateral conductivity and transparency in TCO ﬁlms. And in RE structures, by alternating the p/n junction with the high/low junction [32,152,153] at the front side, the lateral transport of the free carriers partially shifted from the TCO ﬁlms into the Si wafer, slightly decreasing the Rsheet. As a result, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties becomes less stringent at the front side [119,153]. Therefore, the requirements of the TCO ﬁlms for the front and the rear sides are different, depending on the structures of the SHJ solar cells. In RE structures, the requirement of the front side TCO ﬁlms is primarily on their optical properties rather than their electrical ones, which means low absorption and high carrier mobility but relatively low Fig. 7.

While the rear side needs better electron properties like relatively high carrier density and high carrier mobility. ITO materials have been widely applied as transparent electrodes, ever since the beginning of the SHJ solar cell development. It has been proven that the ratio of In:Sn played an important role in manipulating the carrier density, mobility, and transmittance of the ITO ﬁlms [59]. In SHJ solar cell mass production, 97/3-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 97/3) are chosen as the front TCO layers due to their excellent transparent capacity [154]. While 90/10-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 90/10) are integrated on the rear sides because of their low resistance [154]. With the improvement of PCEs of the SHJ solar cells, the relatively low carrier mobility of the ITO materials of less than 40 cm/(V$s) is gradually becoming a limiting factor, especially on the front side. Therefore, to improve the PCE of the SHJ solar cells, TCO materials with excellent transparency and high carrier mobility are introduced into the cells. Dong et al. [14]. selected a multidoped indium-based material IMO:H to enhance the charge mobility of the front TCO ﬁlms, and a certiﬁed PCE of 25.26% is accomplished. The IMO:H layers exhibited high carrier mobility of over 70 cm/(V$s) at a Ne of around 2 1020 cm3 and improved transmittance within below the 400-nm-wavelength range. Additionally, the IMO: H ﬁlms were also proven to possess lower rc with mc-Si:H(n). Besides the PCEs, the total cost of SHJ solar cell is also a critical obstacle to industrialization. Beneﬁting the uniquely indispensable TCO layers in SHJ, a low-temperatureesintering metal paste could be used, providing the possibility to reduce the cost by using scarce materials. Silver in the grid electrodes is going to be reduced or replaced by a base metal, such as Cu@Ag core-shell materials [155] or Cu with surface oxidation resistance [156]. Until 2021, the costs of TCO targets are still an important factor, which spend more than 10% of the consumable costs [7]. The main reason is the relatively high price of indium [26]. Hence, indium-free TCO materials, such as AZO [112,145], are also attempted to integrate into the SHJ solar cells. Compared with ITO, stability veriﬁed by industry and academia, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance since the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved issue. AZO ﬁlms still face challenges of relatively high resistivity [157,158]. Another possible approach would be using multilayered AR coatings such as SiOx [24], SiNx [118,119], and MgF2 [117] on top of extremely thin ITO layers. In this way, the usage of indium could be reduced while still maintaining low resistivity contact. For example, SHJ solar cells have the potential to achieve an excellent Jsc beyond 42 mA/cm2 if the front-side ITO layer can be replaced by an ITO/SiNx double layer [118,119]. 5. Summary and perspective Herein, we presented a comprehensive review covering all the aspects of TCO ﬁlms in the application of SHJ solar cells, from basic functions to materials, as well as their application in mass production. SHJ solar cells are a fundamental approach for accomplishing high-efﬁciency PV devices. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms act as literal conductive layers which connect the doped a-/mc-Si:H layers and the metal grids. As a fundamental role in the solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms have a key impact on PCEs and the production cost of the solar cell intensively. ITO materials are still the most widely applied TCOs in SHJ solar cells in mass production. But their relatively low carrier mobility of less than 40 cm/(Vs) is becoming a limiting factor to meet the continuous demand for elevating solar cell performance. Meanwhile, the high indium consumption of ITO ﬁlms hinders further reducing the production cost. Therefore, TCO materials, deposition techniques as well as PVD equipment should be further investigated for SHJ solar cells to enhance the performance and mitigate the cost. Here, we outline possible research approaches and challenges that have to be addressed for the future development of TCO ﬁlms. Development of high-mobility TCOs. In TCO ﬁlms, it is a tradeoff between the conductivity and the transparency via tuning Ne. While with the improvement of m, the conductivity of TCO ﬁlms could be enhanced without any losses in transmittance. Hence, the development of high-mobility (>100 cm2/(Vs)) TCO materials is highly required for the mass production of SHJ solar cells. Application of multilayered TCO structures. To deduct the rc of the TCO/doped a-Si:H and the TCO/Ag grid interfaces, the materials composite from the front to the rear side of TCO ﬁlms should be different. Consequently, multilayer structures, in which materials with different WFs or Ne, should be applied in TCO ﬁlms. Low-damage TCO coating methods. The PVD coating methods and processes to fabricate TCO ﬁlms play a signiﬁcant role on the passivation effect of the substrates. Therefore, the development of low-damage TCO coating equipment or processes that are suitable for mass production is indispensable for improving cell efﬁciency. Reduction of indium consumption. The high indium consumption of TCO ﬁlms is one of the detrimental factors that hinders the cost reduction of SHJ solar cells. To deduct the indium consumption or develop indium-free TCO ﬁlms, it is highly required to apply in SHJ solar cells. Meanwhile, the technique of deposition of an ARC on top of the TCO ﬁlms, which means shrinking the thickness of TCO ﬁlms, also should be applied in solar cells. Silicon solar cells can be manufactured, even at the TW scale, where the photoactive bulk silicon layer avoids any scarce materials, and the silver grid electrode is going to be substituted by base metals, such as copper. SHJ solar cells are going to be the predominant production in the market of Si-based PV devices in the future. As the key cost issues for the SHJ devices, the development of TCO ﬁlms still faces some challenges. We believe this review would prompt us to learn the achievements, remaining challenges, as well as possible investigation directions, and promote the development of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells rapidly.

Introduction The world market of photovoltaics (PV) is currently dominated by crystal silicon (c-Si)-based solar cells, which occupy a market share of approximately 95% in 2019 [1,2]. Amongst c-Si solar cells, aluminum back surface ﬁeld (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells (Fig. 1a), which are also named by homojunction c-Si solar cells, are predominating in large-scale industrial solar cell products (Fig. 1b). However, due to the high carrier recombination at the silicon surface, the values of the power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of Al-BSF cells and PERC cells are reaching their limitation, which are around 20% and 24% [3], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. Besides, the polysilicon-passivated junction technique, built by embedding a thin silicon oxide layer atop a c-Si substrate, also named tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), is emerging as a promising alternative. And a record PCE of 26.4% [4] has been achieved in TOPCon cells. As an alternative, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technique is an important approach for the next generation of highefﬁciency PV productions [1,6,7], as predicted in Fig. 1d. In the 1990s, Sanyo Co. invented the ﬁrst SHJ solar cell, which integrated a boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter with an n-type c-Si wafer and achieved a PCE close to 12% [8]. And then Sanyo Co. improved the PCE to 22.8% [9] and 23.7% [10] in 2009 and 2011, respectively, in which the carrier concentration of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms was reduced to mitigate free carrier absorption (FCA), while the Hall mobility was improved to optimize the lateral conductivity. In 2013, they further enhanced the PCE to 24.7% [11]. And then, the PCE of double-side SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% [12] on a large area device of 151.9 cm2 by Kaneka Co. in 2015 due to high ﬁll factor (FF) of 83%.

All rights reserved. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 SHJ solar cells to reduce the parasitic absorption from the a-Si:H and TCO layers, resulting in a record PCE of 26.7% [13] in 2017. In 2022, SHJ solar cells based on transition metal doped indium oxide (IMO) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (m-Si:H) achieved a PCE of 25.26% [14]. And in the same year, Longi Co. raised the world-record PCE to 26.81% [15] for SHJ solar cells, approaching the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [16]. In recent years, several industry players joined the SHJ solar cell market. As predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic [2], SHJ cells are expected to gain a market share of about 10% in 2025, corresponding to a shipment of over 100 GW per year. In future mass manufacture, due to the relatively low temperatures in fabrication processes, SHJ solar cells can tolerate continually thinner c-Si thickness (up to 80 mm), which would exactly cater to the cost reduction for the PV industry. Due to the poor lateral conductivity of the doped a-Si:H layers in SHJ solar cells, the front and rear sides of the devices must be combined with transparent electrode layers to deliver the photogenerated charges to the terminals. Amongst all the materials for the transparent electrodes, TCOs are ideal candidates to meet the requirement. TCOs are intrinsically wide band-gap materials, typically metal oxides, that can be heavily doped and serve as transparent conductors for charge carrier extraction at the device terminals [17e22]. Since the 1960s and 1970s, TCOs have witnessed the revolutionary development of SHJ solar cells due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties [23e26]. Existing reviews on this topic either emphasize all aspects of SHJ solar cells or are out of date [1,7,27e29]. In other works, researchers reviewed the achievements and the challenges of TCO ﬁlms [30e32]. As TCOs are fundamental materials for SHJ solar cells, a systematic review of material selection, characterization, and gigawatt-scale production is essential but still lacking. This article reviews the general requirements and the status of the development of TCO ﬁlms targeting high-performance SHJ solar cells. In the ﬁrst section, we listed and discussed the relevant properties of TCO ﬁlms for the application in SHJ solar cells, including conductivity, transparency as well as contact resistance at the interfaces. Additionally, we also elucidated the inﬂuence factors and the control strategies for the passivation detrimental effect during the deposition of TCO ﬁlms. In the second section, we summarized the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells, focusing on their inﬂuence on work function (WF), resistivity, and transmittance on the performance of SHJ solar cells. In the third section, we presented the current state and developing trend of TCO ﬁlms in the industrialization of SHJ solar cells. 2. Application requirements of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells 2.1. Transparency, reﬂectance, and conductivity of TCO ﬁlms In SHJ solar cells, both optical and electrical properties are signiﬁcant for TCO ﬁlms. However, there is always a trade-off between these two properties. The improvement of the transparency of the Fig. 1.

(d) The schematic of silicon heterojunction solar cells. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 2 TCO ﬁlms always leads to the reduction of the conductivity, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the optical and electrical properties of TCO ﬁlms to achieve desirable performance in SHJ solar cells. As bifacial devices, the performance of SHJ solar cells is primarily inﬂuenced by the optical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, including transparency and antireﬂection (AR) properties, at both the front and rear sides. The transparency of the TCO ﬁlms is mainly determined by the band structure and the deposition condition [33]. For application in SHJ solar cells, the material should possess decent transmittance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. For this reason, typical metal oxides with a fundamental bandgap larger than 3 eV [33,34], including indium oxide (In2O3) [35], tin oxide (SnO2) [36,37], and zinc oxide (ZnO) [35,38], are widely applied in TCO ﬁlms. To improve their conductivity, the metal oxides are doped by other elements to shift the Fermi level into the conduction band, during which the free carrier concentration (Ne) in the oxides is improved. The transmittance toward the long wavelength region is tremendously affected by Ne. According to Drude theory, the plasma frequency u could be written as Equation (1) [39,40]: u2 ¼ e2$Ne ε0$εr$m* (1) where, e is the electric charge carried by a single electron, and ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. The plasma frequency deﬁned the onset of the FCA, thus the increase of Ne would reduce the transmittance of the TCO ﬁlms at a long wavelength range. Generally, TCO ﬁlms also act the role of AR coatings, which determines the thickness of the ﬁlms. The reﬂectance on the Si surface is minimized for one wavelength, which is given by Ref. [33]: dTCO ¼ l 4n (2) where, l is the wavelength at which the reﬂectance is minimized, n is the refractive index of the TCO ﬁlms at the wavelength, and dTCO is the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. Generally, to achieve the best PCE performance, the solar cell should present the lowest reﬂectance at the visible light range (400e760 nm), which determines the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. For example, for indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlms on the front side of the SHJ solar cells, the thickness is generally set at 70e80 nm since ITO exhibits an n of approximately 1.9 at the wavelength of 580 nm [41]. For the TCO ﬁlms on the rear sides, the thickness could be a bit larger to mitigate the sheet resistance (Rsheet) at the cost of reducing the PCE measured at the rear side (for bifacial cells). In SHJ solar cells, the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms determines the pitch of the metal grids. A decrease of Rsheet allows a larger pitch of the metal grid, which then beneﬁts the cell performance by reducing themetal shading area as well as improving lateral transportation. Since Rsheet is deﬁned as Rsheet ¼ r/dTCO, either reducing electrical resistivity (r) or accumulating dTCO enables Rsheet smaller. However, as discussed above, dTCO is determined mainly by the antireﬂectance performance. In the TCO ﬁlms, the relationships among resistivity r, Ne, and the carrier mobility (m) could be described as Equation (3) [42], r ¼ 1 eNem (3) Either the improvement of Ne or m leads to a decrease in r, which further reduces Rsheet and improves FF in solar cells. Most TCO materials are n-type semiconductors, and Ne of their ﬁlms is primarily determined by the dopant concentration in the host materials. Besides, Ne could also be tuned by deposition conditions, such as deposition power [43], the pressure of the chamber [44], partial pressure of oxygen [45e47] and water [48,49] etc, which results in a value of Ne in the range from 1019 to 1021 cm3 [50]. Since the increase of Ne degrades the transparency of the TCO ﬁlms in the visible and near-infrared region, the best strategy to reduce Rsheet is to increase m while limiting Ne. The m in n-type materials could be written as Equation (4) [33,51], m ¼ et m* (4) where, t is the relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band, respectively. Different scattering mechanisms caused by ionized impurities, neutral impurities, or gain boundaries have an impact on the relaxation time of the carriers in the TCO ﬁlms and decrease m [33,51]. For the ITO ﬁlms applied in SHJ solar cells, typical motilities are 20e40 cm2/(V$s) [35,52]. Therefore, as the aspect of the solar cell performance, it is a trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. The increase of Ne leads to an improvement in conductivity but a reduction in transparency, while the decrease results in a contrary result. To balance the optical and the electrical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, the ﬁgure of merit (FTC) is intruded to evaluate the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms on solar cell performance, which is deﬁned as Equation (5) [53]: FTC ¼ T10 avg Rsheet (5) With the Tavg the average of the transmittance of the ﬁlms. The larger FTC means a better compromise between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms, which leads to better performance of the solar cells. 2.2. Carrier transportation at TCO interfaces In the structure of SHJ solar cells, TCO ﬁlms connect the carrier selective layers and the metal electrodes, enabling the TCO ﬁlms important roles in carrier transportation at the interfaces. Amongst all the interfaces in SHJ solar cells, the carrier transportation at the TCO/doped a-Si:H interfaces has a critical contribution to the series resistivity losses [54,55]. To study the contact resistivity (rc) at the interfaces, the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts are generally considered as Schottky contacts, in which the carrier transportation is typically governed by the energy band alignment [56,57]. According to simulation results, the WF difference between the TCO ﬁlm and the a-Si:H layer has a strong inﬂuence on the contact resistance [58,59]. That means the WF requirements for the TCO ﬁlms of the electron contact (TCO/a-Si(n)) and the hole contact (TCO/a-Si(p)) are different. As reported by Ritzau et al. [56], as shown in Fig. 2a, for the ideal electron contacts, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be lower than 4.2 eV, which is close to the Fermi level of the a-Si:H(n) layers. While for the hole contacts at the TCO/a-Si:H(p) interfaces, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be higher than that of the a-Si:H(p) layers (~5.3 eV) [60]. However, the TCO materials applied in SHJ solar cells are typically n-type semiconductors with relatively low WFs, such as ITO (4.2e4.5eV) [36,37], aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) (3.4e4.5eV) [61], etc, which do not meet the requirements for the hole contacts. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the patterns with the aSi:H(p)/ITO or a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact exhibit lower open circuit voltages (VOCs) at high illumination intensity than the ones with a W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 3 high WF WOx layer, conﬁrming that large Schottky barriers are formed in the former contacts and hinder carrier transportation at the interfaces. To suppress rc of the hole contacts, high WF transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxides (MoOx) [61e63], tungsten oxides (WOx) [61,64,65], and vanadium oxides (VOx) [66], are integrated into SHJ solar cells as contact modiﬁcation layers. Regarding the a-Si:H(p) layers, a sufﬁciently high net doping concentration is necessary to optimize rc by avoiding the hole-selective layer from being depleted [55,67,68]. But the rising of the doping concentration burdens the defect densities in the a-Si:H layers [69,70], ﬁxing the effective net doping at a level below 1017 cm3. To realize this strategy, doped hydrogenated nano- or microcrystalSi (nc-Si:H [68,71] or mc-Si:H [14]) layers, in which the effective net doping level could be higher than 1019 cm3, are integrated into SHJ solar cells, alternating the doped a-Si:H layers. Zhao et al. reported SHJ solar cells with the nc-Si:H(p)/ITO contact and achieved low contact resistance (rc of 0.144 U,cm2) successfully [72]. As discussed above, the traditional transportation exploration at the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts is mainly based on direct tunneling (DT), which is highly dependent on energy alignment. While in recent works, besides the DT mode, indirect tunneling (IDT) modes, such as trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and band-to-band tunneling (B2BT), are taken into consideration as well in the simulation of charge carrier transportation at the hole and the electron contacts in SHJ solar cell. Fig. 3a and b show typical carrier transport processes based on the DT and IDT modes at the n- and the p-contact. At the n-contact, the carrier transportation is primarily dominated by the DT mode and supported by TAT mode partially. While at the p-contact, the IDT mode is the dominant one instead of the DT mode. Regarding carrier transportation by either DT or IDT, the charge Ne of TCO ﬁlms plays an important role. On the one hand, the increase of Ne leads to the decrease of the WFs of TCO ﬁlms [73], which beneﬁts DT at the electron contact but deteriorates the WF mismatch at the hole contact. On the other hand, larger Ne is beneﬁcial for IDT on both sides of the solar cells [70,73,74]. Therefore, large Ne in TCO ﬁlms is helpful to maintain low rc at the electron contact areas. While for the hole contacts, due to the WF mismatch, the carrier transportation at the interfaces is primarily determined by IDT but is also impacted by the energy alignment. So, appropriate Ne of the ITO ﬁlms is required for the hole contacts with small rc. In Fig. 3c, rc for the hole contacts is plotted against Ne of the TCO ﬁlms [70]. At the active energy (Ea) of the a-Si:H(p) layer at 275 meV, the lowest rc is located at Ne value of approximately 2 1020 cm3. When the Ne rises above this value, the rc slightly increases due to the WF mismatch, while the rc rises monotonically with the reducing Ne below 2 1020 cm3. The TCO/metal contacts on both sides of the SHJ solar cells are another important factor that should be taken into consideration. In the manufacture of SHJ solar cells, screen printing with lowtemperature sintering metal pastes is the most widely applied technique for metallization. During this process, silver (Ag) or silver-coated copper (Ag@Cu) pastes are printed on the TCO surfaces, and metal grid electrodes are formed after drying and sintering processes with temperatures less than 200 C. Generally, the rc of the TCO/silver grid contacts (rc, TCO/Ag) is primarily dominated by the Ne in TCO ﬁlms [75]. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO/metal contacts are always treated as Schottky contacts [75]. As a highly doped semiconductor (Ne > 1019 cm3), ﬁeld emission (FE) or thermionic ﬁeld emission (TFE) is the dominant transportation mode at the contact [75,76]. According to the Schottky metal/semiconductor junction theory, an increase in Ne in TCO ﬁlms leads to a thinner potential barrier at the TCO/metal interfaces. Hence, the chance of charge carrier tunneling through the barriers should be enhanced, and rc,TCO/Ag is reduced accordingly. As shown in Fig. 3d, Schube et al. proved that rc,ITO/Ag decreases with the increase of Ne in the ITO layers under similar printing and sintering conditions [77]. 2.3. Degradation of passivation during deposition of TCO ﬁlms In recent years, deposition techniques with less damage impact on the a-Si:H layers, such as reactive plasma deposition (RPD) [78], atom layer deposition (ALD) [79e81], and sputtering with mirror shape target conﬁguration [82,83], have been investigated to fabricate TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells. However, conventional pulsed or direct current magnetron sputtering is still the most widely used deposition technique in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, owing to their high deposition rates and scalability. During the sputtering of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated silicon substrate interacts withthe plasma intensively, and a signiﬁcant degradation occurs in the passivation interfaces, leading to a reduction of VOC and pseudo-FF in the solar cell performance [84]. The detrimental effect during sputtering primarily arises from ultraviolet (UV) light luminescence [85,86] in plasma and ion bombardment [87,88], including ion and neutral particles from plasma gas, sputtering targets, and their compounds [89]. And the passivation quality could be partially recovered after a high-temperature treatment during or after the TCO deposition process [84,86]. UV radiation is believed as a damage source for the a-Si: H passivation in SHJ solar cells for a long time [85,90,91]. During the deposition processes of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated Si substrates are under the illumination of plasma and damage occurs in the a-Si:H ﬁlms or at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces. In a-Si:H ﬁlms, the Fig. 2. (a) The simulated ﬁll factor as a function of the work function and a-Si:H doping (n/p type) [56]. (b) Patterns of Suns-VOC measurements (open circuit voltages measured with different illumination) of the p-contact at high illumination intensity (the inset is the respective structure in the measurements) [56].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 4 binding energy of SieH and SieSi is approximately 3.6 eV [92] and 2.5 eV [93], respectively, which is in the UVevisible spectral range. After the illumination of UV light in plasma, the SieSi and the SieH bonds in a-Si:H(i) or a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are partially broken and then the passivation effect of the Si substrates is degraded [86]. B. Demaurex et al. show that the minority carrier lifetime (MCLT) of the a-Si:H passivated Si samples shielded with normal glasses (10% transparency at 4.7 eV) and quartz glasses (10% transparency at 7.8 eV) dropped 14% and 27% after sputtering, respectively, comparing with a value of 96% on bare samples without shielding [86]. It has been proven that the damage should be ascribed to plasma luminescence. During the plasma illuminating process, the surface recombination velocity of the samples would be degraded after a short exposure of 10 s and reach a saturation value after ~60 s [87]. It was interpreted that the UV light triggers the generation of fast metastable defects at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface in several seconds, and the reversible defects become saturated in a minute. Ion bombardment is the most critical part of the detrimental effects. During deposition, the MCLT losses of the passivated Si wafer could be more than 90%, as compared with that before deposition [43,84,86,94]. And merely part of the losses could be recovered after annealing. Generally, the detrimental effects of the particle bombardment are correlated with the thickness of the a-Si: H layer [95], the deposition conditions [89,96] as well as the deposition modes [84,97,98]. The a-Si:H layer with enough thickness enables the protection of the silicon wafer from any damage caused by bombardment during sputtering. However, due to the parasitic absorption [52] and the high resistive property [55,74], the increase of the a-Si:H layer can signiﬁcantly contribute to optical and series resistance losses in solar cells. As reported by L. Tutsch et al., the MCLTs of the wafers passivated with >7-nm-thick aSi:H(i) layers are almost fully restored after sputtering and after sputtering annealing, while the samples with 7-nm-thick passivation layers exhibit severe detrimental effects [95]. It is consistent with the thickness of a-Si:H stacks in SHJ solar cells, which lies approximately 10 nm [14]. Regarding deposition conditions, the degradation induced by ion bombardment could be suppressed by either decreasing the power applied to the targets or increasing the chamber pressure during sputtering [95]. The passivation degradation caused by ion bombardment should be correlated with either ion kinetic energy [99,100] or ion ﬂux [86,87]. Reduction of the power leads to a decrease of the current and voltage on the target, thereby lowing both the ion ﬂux and ion kinetic energy in the plasma deposition process [95]. On the other hand, the improvement of the chamber Fig. 3. The schematic band diagrams and carrier transport mechanisms for (a) the n-contact and (b) the p-contact [73].

Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 5 pressure increases the possibility of being scattered on their way toward the substrate, which then reduces the kinetic energy and the damage of bombardment [95]. L. Tutsch et al. utilized a thin ITO ﬁlm of several nanometers, which was deposited with relatively low power and high chamber pressure to protect the a-Si:H(i) layers-passivated Si wafer from the damage of ion bombardment [43]. As a result, the lifetime of the protected samples was improved by several folds, and their iVoc was enhanced for ~26 mV in comparison with the baseline samples. The comparison of passivation degradation among different sputtering modes, including radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), and pulsed DC modes, was summarized [84,97,98]. Due to the lower target voltage (RF: 112 V, DC: >200 V), RF sputtering exhibits less bombardmentinduced damage to the passivated substrates both after sputtering and recovering after annealing. Regardless of the damage sources in the TCO deposition process, the a-Si:H-based surface passivation can be recovered by 180e200 C thermal annealing either during or after the deposition [87,101,102]. During the thermal treatment process, the carrier concentration at the c-Si surface (band bending) would be tuned. It was reported that the surface defects in a-Si:H passivation layers can be eliminated after annealing at 180 C [101]. This effect is due to the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the a-Si:H(i) bulk toward dangling bonds at the c-Si surface, and the latter is then passivated by the formation of monohydrides. It is likely that the repassivation of dangling bonds, caused by the sputter-induced SieH bond rupture, follows the same principles. As reported by Demaurex et al. [86], the microstructural modiﬁcation in the a-Si:H layers after sputtering and annealing was investigated by a Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement. In this report, the authors showed that both monohydride and multihydride bonds in the a-Si:H layers were descended after sputtering, while the hydride bonds recovered partially after short annealing. 3. Classiﬁcation of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells Due to its superior photoelectric property and long-term stability, ITO is widely used in optoelectronic applications and has become the standard material for SHJ solar cells [1,7]. Meanwhile, the optoelectrical performance can be further improved by tuning the composition or interface modiﬁcation. To reduce the use of the rare indium element, it is an attractive way to ﬁnd low-cost substitutes with indium-based TCOs. AZO is a natively polycrystalline material with lower electronic quality than ITO when deposited at low temperatures (<200 C) and as a thin layer (<100 nm), making it an attractive low-cost substitute [31,103]. Indium-based oxides [45,98,104e108] and zinc-based oxides [109e115] are the most widely studied two TCO categories in SHJ solar cells. Each of them has its limitations. In this section, we attempt to review the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells and their performance in SHJ solar cells. 3.1. Doped indium oxides In recent years, indium-based TCOs have attracted wide attention and been reviewed, thanks to their high conductivity to ensure the transportation of photogenerated charges as well as outstanding transparency to the sun spectrum [19]. Despite the limited indium content in the earth's crust, various cation-doped In2O3 have been investigated so far in SHJ solar cells [24,25]. Indium oxide doped with hydrogen, tin, tungsten, cerium, etc. are commonly used TCO materials in SHJ cells. In the following part, roadmaps toward higher efﬁciency by using indium-based oxides as TCOs in SHJ solar cells would be discussed. 3.1.1. ITO Currently, more than 70% of indium is used in the production of ITO materials, which subsequently has broadly been applied as TCO ﬁlms in the production of industrial SHJ solar cells [24,25]. The relatively low resistivity, high transparency, and large-scale production capability make ITO well-suited for displaying the transport channel layer on both sides in SHJ solar cells. Additionally, long-time stability and facile production are other factors to contribute ITO as the dominant TCO electrodes. Consequently, continuous improvements in industrial PCE performance have been obtained, and the breakthrough efﬁciency of double-side contacted SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% in 2015 [12], a world record, surpassing the champion efﬁciency of homojunction PERC cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Kaneka Corp. published their work on IBCSHJ (structure as Fig. 4b) with the ﬁrst silicon solar cell exceeding a PCE of 26% with a FF of 83.8% [24]. Later in 2017, further progress in eliminating the parasitic absorption of a-Si:H layers by using IBC structures was reported to be a PCE of 26.7% [13]. A world-record PCE of 26.81% is achieved by LONGI Co. in 2022. However, compared with the theoretical PCE limit (close to the 28.5% theoretical ceiling predicted for a 1.1 eV band gap material), there is still a noticeable gap for the further development of ITO in SHJ solar cells in the coming years. Most notably, the PCE of current SHJ devices is limited by the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. Due to the relatively low carrier mobility, which is generally below 40 cm2/(Vs), ITO ﬁlms are not able to achieve high transparency and decent conductivity at the same time [1,21,24,117]. That tradeoff limits the improvement of the solar cell PCE. Moreover, the strategies of pattern processing structures or multilayer reﬂectors have been reported that do not balance the conﬂicting optical and electrical properties of ITO in SHJ devices [24,117e119], but any additional layers and processes might burden the cost and complexity for the cell fabrication process. Thus, the approach for developing new TCOs with high carrier mobility and low extinction coefﬁcient is necessary. 3.1.2. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) By alternating tin in ITO materials with hydrogen to form hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H), a high m of 100 cm2/(Vs) has been achieved. The IO:H ﬁlms exhibit extremely low solar-average absorption, coming in as one of the most ideal materials to replace ITO at the front side (Fig. 5a) [39,55,120,121e124]. By replacing the front ITO layer with IO:H, Koida et al. demonstrated a PCE of 16.1% for the SHJ solar cells [122]. A large-scale (153.4 cm2) device with a PCE of 21.13% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.18 mA/cm2 was exhibited, showing an obvious enhancement compared to the ITO counterparts (Fig. 5b) [125]. Indeed, the incorporation of the IO:H ﬁlms, instead of the conventional ITO ﬁlms, enhances the Jsc and the resulting PCE. The detailed analysis of the solar cells revealed that the appearance of hydrogen atoms as single-charged donors and their ability to passivate defects at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline ﬁlms led to the reduction of reﬂection loss at the IO:H/a-Si:H interface and less optical absorption in the IO:H layers [39,120,123,124]. Compared with ITO and IZO ﬁlms, the resulting IO:H ﬁlms feature both high carrier mobility (with the best value of 100 cm2/V$s) and large band gap values after annealing, which contribute to the Jsc of 39.18 mA/cm2 [125]. Compared with the ITO materials, IO:H suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the metal front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting an ITO layer between IO:H and Ag [120]. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, low Rsheet as well as small free-carrier absorption, outperforming the IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells (Fig. 5c) [120]. A remarkable PCE of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen- W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 6 printed SHJ solar cell was obtained by employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide. Nevertheless, copper plating was also investigated to reduce the expensive silver usage. A certiﬁed solar cell device with a PCE of 22.5% (FF of 80%) is demonstrated utilizing the combination of a-Si:H/MoOx, layers, IO:H ﬁlms, and copper-plated grids (Fig. 5d) [126]. These results demonstrate that IO:H is quite an attractive alternative to ITO for SHJ solar cells. 3.1.3. Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), the substitution of W6þ for In3þ, is a kind of TCO ﬁlm that can provide more carriers while reducing the defect concentration, compared to ITO ﬁlms [127]. IWO ﬁlms show high carrier mobility values of 50e80 cm2/(Vs) [19]. Beneﬁting from their high electron mobility, IWO layers not only yield low resistivity but also show high NIR transmittance (94.21% at a 80 nm thickness). Moreover, there are many Fig. 4.

Due to the high carrier mobility, IWO materials are integrated into SHJ solar cells as transparent electrode layers on both the front and the rear sides, reducing both Rsheet and FCA and leading to improved performances in the solar cells (Fig. 6a). In the early stage, to obtain appropriate carrier mobility above 60 cm2/(Vs), the deposition temperature was higher than 300 C for a long time [128]. However, this is contrary to the low process temperature requirement of SHJ solar cells. Subsequently, a series of low-temperature technologies were reported to adapt the application environment for SHJ solar cells, such as low-damage RPD or room-temperature sputtering technology [1,127e132]. Consequently, improved performances were achieved for the IWO-based SHJ solar cells to exceed 20% (Table 1). With the application of high-performance titanium and tungsten co-doped indium oxide ﬁlms, large-scale SHJ solar cells (243.34 cm2) with a high average PCE of 23.8% (with a Voc of 0.746 V, a Jsc of 38.7 mA/ cm2 and FF of 82.9%) were fabricated, in which the PCE was still lower than that for the record ITO-based SHJ solar cells yet [133]. Similar to the a-Si:H/ITO interface, the a-Si:H/IWO interfacial contact is also one of the crucial factors limiting the PCEs of the SHJ solar cells. A series of strategies are applied to optimize the Schottky barrier between p-a-Si:H and IWO. One approach is to apply MgF2 as a double-layer AR coating on top of the optimal device, the EQEintegrated Jsc was improved from 39.41 mA/cm2 to 40.16 mA/cm2 [128]. The ﬁnal 8.97-cm2 wide IWO/MgF2-based solar cell showed an active area cell efﬁciency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efﬁciency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b, Table 1) [128]. Additionally, the H diffusion from a-Si:H to tungsten-doped indium (IWOH) is reported to not only reduce the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms but also optimize the interfaces of a-Si:H/IWO [130]. The improved PCE of 22.3% for the IWOH-based solar cells was achieved on an average for 4cm2 SHJ cells, which have higher Jsc and PCEs than the IWO-based solar cell and similar FF [130]. Further, the prolonged hydrogen annealing process for the IWO-based solar cells gained the PCE by 1.14% to 23.31%, with a device area of 244.5 cm2 [129]. The aspect of electrical and optical properties, IWO is a desirable material for industrial SHJ solar cells, especially in solar cells with low-cost copper conductor grids [138]. A SHJ solar cell with copper as the metal grids and IWO as the transparent electrodes, which are fabricated in the lab and SIMIT's R&D line, reached a PCE of over 22%, showing great potential for the copper metallization of the SHJ solar cells with reduced cost and overcoming the limitations of screen-printing technology (Fig. 6c) [131]. By now, there is a consensus within the industrialization of IWO that the content of indium in the excellent performance of IWO (In:W ¼ 95:5) is still insufﬁciently ideal [128,129,137,133], where the high production costs would the pressing issue. In a word, IWO can provide advantages over ITO due to its lower absorption in the long wavelength region. However, there is still room for further improvement in conversion efﬁciency. Fig. 6.

Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 8 3.1.4. Alternative doped indium oxide To date, there are indium-based TCOs with other doping metals such as cerium, titanium, and zirconium, which mainly perform as front transparent electrodes for the solar cells having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region [78,125,139e141]. The large potential of the optimally processed In2O3:Ce:H (ICO:H) window layers in SHJ cells is demonstrated, quantiﬁed by the improvement in Jsc of 0.6 mA/cm2 without impairing the resistive losses in comparison to the usage of baseline ITO layers [139]. By further incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional ITO and IO:H ﬁlms, an improved PCE of 24.1%, a Voc of 745 mV, a Jsc of 38.8 mA/ cm2, and a FF of 83.2% were obtained [78]. It is believed that their high carrier mobility of 140 cm2/(V$s) contributed to their high efﬁciency. Already, SHJ solar cells with the optimized indium zirconium oxide (IZrO) front electrodes resulted in a Jsc of 40 mA/cm2, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 23.4% [141]. A heterojunction solar cell with an ITO/IZrO bilayer electrode succeeds in a Jsc of 38.72 mA/ cm2, a FF of 82.39%, and a PCE of up to 23.59% [140]. Similarly, the signiﬁcant reduction of the reﬂection loss of the conventional and needle-like Hf-doped In2O3 (IHFO) bilayer ﬁlms deposited on the textured silicon was observed. The short-circuit current and efﬁciency of the solar cell were improved by 0.52 mA/cm2 and 0.39%, utilizing a needle-like IHFO thin ﬁlm as an AR layer [134]. As for the manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells increases or future tandem devices, there are signiﬁcant concerns about the use of indium. The values of indium consumption per cell and per generated power for SHJ solar cells from different sources exhibited large discrepancies, but all available data indicate concern about the insufﬁcient supply of indium to support in the future [25]. Signiﬁcantly, reducing indium consumption for TCO ﬁlms has become mandatory to push SHJ solar cell technology toward a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. As an alternative to minimizing the use of metallic indium, thin indiumbased TCOs (with better performance) or the IBC cell design might be a choice. With a reduced thickness of approximately 30 nm for ITO layers, the resource-sustainable manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells would be substantially increased to 115e330 GW. However, this would only account for approximately 5e10% of a 3 TW market size, suggesting that the SHJ solar cell using ITO in some form remains a niche product. Moreover, reducing the thickness of ITO layers could also lead to signiﬁcant increases in rc due to the changes in current pathways and the current crowding effect. For example, 20-nm-thick ITO capped by a non-indiumbased TCO would greatly increase the sustainable manufacturing capacity compared to the present implementation for SHJ solar cells relying solely on ITO [25]. Thus, substituting part or full of ITO with a more transparent and less expensive dielectric indium-free ﬁlm is promising. 3.2. Doped zinc oxide Typically, an approximately 70-nm-thick ITO layer is used on each surface to form thin transparent conductive layers at the front and rear of the SHJ solar cells, corresponding to approximately 5.7 mg/W consumption of ITO and 4.2 mg/W consumption of indium, with an assumed cell PCE of 25.11% [25]. Thus, the future of cSi PVs would beneﬁt greatly from any alternative indium-free layer to circumvent the parasitic absorption in TCOs. As for the choice of indium-free TCOs in SHJ, AZOs, with low cost, abundant material reserves in nature and capability of achieving comparable efﬁciencies to the ITO-based SHJ solar cells, has been considered as one of the few potential alternatives to ITOs [109,142]. To reduce the use of indium, both ITO 50%/AZO 50% and ITO 25%/ AZO 50%/ITO 25% were used on the back of SHJ solar cells with a decent performance, which was close to that of individual ITO (Fig. 7a) [114]. The performance of the SHJ solar cells with such two kinds of TCO stacks as the back TCO layers was greatly improved compared to that with the individual AZO layer [114]. Meanwhile, the PCE gap between such the ITO/AZO stacks and the individual ITO stack could be narrowed to approximately 0.1% (absolute value), showing the possibility of applying the ITO/AZO stack structure in the SHJ solar cell [114]. Considering the use of indium-free TCOs, the AZO layers were used in three different cell conﬁgurations labeled as ‘front-AZO cell’, ‘back-AZO cell’. and ‘all-AZO cell’ [144]. At the early stage, it was found that the PCE was challenging to exceed 20% for the SHJ solar cells with the direct application of the individual AZO ﬁlm as a front-AZO cell (Table 2) [109,142]. For further improving the light coupling by textured AZO or the implementation of the electrochemically grown ZnO nanorod as AR layers on AZO, less discernible enhancement of the PCE was observed (Fig. 7b) [142]. Thanks to the optimization of experimental conditions for AZO, the abovementioned front AZO cell showed an overall increasing PCE of over 20% [143]. The low PCE was attributed to the poor contact of aSi:H(p)/AZO and the low electrical and optical properties of AZO. The optimized low-resistivity a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact by the implementation of a trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) doped a-Si:H(p) ﬁlm as a hole transport layer enables a FF above 81% and a PCE of 23.6% for the front-AZO SHJ solar cells, comparable with 23.7%-efﬁcient cells using traditional ITO (Fig. 7c) [143]. In addition, the back-AZO cell experienced a similar performance improvement path as that of the front-AZO cell. Featuring a standard screen-printed silver grid at the front with approximately 3.25% optical shadowing, a champion device of the black-AZO cell a Jsc of up to 40.81 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 23.96% was obtained [112]. As for all-AZO cells, a 4-cm2 cell was certiﬁed at ISFH CalTec with an efﬁciency of 23.0%, a VOC of 738.8 mV, a FF of 80.3%, and a JSC of 38.7 mA/cm2 [145].

W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 9 Furthermore, an all-AZO cell with a 244 cm2 total area reached a PCE as high as 21.3% by using an amorphous silicon oxide layer (aSiO2) as an AR coating. Thus far, AZO appeared to be a promising indium-free alternative material to replace the back ITO commonly used in SHJ solar cells. Remarkably, the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved problem [113,145]. Signiﬁcantly increasing electrical resistivity and surface degradation were obtained, when the AZO is exposed to a harsh environment (e.g. annealing in the air or humidity damping). Damp heat test results of encapsulated SHJ devices with AZO as the TCO ﬁlms exhibited relative FF degradation of 7% after 1000 h [145]. This drawback prevents AZO ﬁlms to be deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices. Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of effort still needs to be put into battle with the relatively poor conductivity and long-term stability of AZO layers. For example, the FF degradation rate might reduce with the deposition of a-SiO2 or SiNx under humid conditions [145]. However, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance. 3.3. Other TCOs Alternatively, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and graphene have also attracted attention [146e151]. Ag NWselectrodes can be deposited on top of the SHJ structure by mechanical transfer or solution technologies while achieving excellent transmittance and conductivity. However, Ag was reported to maintain low contact resistance between the silicon layer and metal, but it could easily react with a thin-ﬁlm silicon layer to form an insulating layer of AgO that blocks charge extraction. The issues remain to be tackled in the other metal-based TCOs, such as Ti, Cu, et al. [23] By inserting a SiNx layer to suppress the deterioration of the passivation quality of the Ti layer induced by direct metal-to-a-Si:H contacts, an indium-free design for SHJ solar cells achieve low series resistivity, a decent FF (80.7%), and efﬁciencies (>22%) [118]. Regarding graphene-based TCOs, until now, it is still arguable for use as a transparent electrode for any solar cell, since it would absorb signiﬁcantly over the full spectrum and shows large Rsheet [147]. 4. TCO ﬁlms for practical applications In mass production, rear-emitter (RE) structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n)/TCO/metal) are nowadays widely applied in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, taking the place of the traditional front emitter structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/TCO/metal) [7,14,152]. As discussed above , it is a trade-off between lateral conductivity and transparency in TCO ﬁlms. And in RE structures, by alternating the p/n junction with the high/low junction [32,152,153] at the front side, the lateral transport of the free carriers partially shifted from the TCO ﬁlms into the Si wafer, slightly decreasing the Rsheet. As a result, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties becomes less stringent at the front side [119,153]. Therefore, the requirements of the TCO ﬁlms for the front and the rear sides are different, depending on the structures of the SHJ solar cells. In RE structures, the requirement of the front side TCO ﬁlms is primarily on their optical properties rather than their electrical ones, which means low absorption and high carrier mobility but relatively low Fig. 7.

While the rear side needs better electron properties like relatively high carrier density and high carrier mobility. ITO materials have been widely applied as transparent electrodes, ever since the beginning of the SHJ solar cell development. It has been proven that the ratio of In:Sn played an important role in manipulating the carrier density, mobility, and transmittance of the ITO ﬁlms [59]. In SHJ solar cell mass production, 97/3-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 97/3) are chosen as the front TCO layers due to their excellent transparent capacity [154]. While 90/10-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 90/10) are integrated on the rear sides because of their low resistance [154]. With the improvement of PCEs of the SHJ solar cells, the relatively low carrier mobility of the ITO materials of less than 40 cm/(V$s) is gradually becoming a limiting factor, especially on the front side. Therefore, to improve the PCE of the SHJ solar cells, TCO materials with excellent transparency and high carrier mobility are introduced into the cells. Dong et al. [14]. selected a multidoped indium-based material IMO:H to enhance the charge mobility of the front TCO ﬁlms, and a certiﬁed PCE of 25.26% is accomplished. The IMO:H layers exhibited high carrier mobility of over 70 cm/(V$s) at a Ne of around 2 1020 cm3 and improved transmittance within below the 400-nm-wavelength range. Additionally, the IMO: H ﬁlms were also proven to possess lower rc with mc-Si:H(n). Besides the PCEs, the total cost of SHJ solar cell is also a critical obstacle to industrialization. Beneﬁting the uniquely indispensable TCO layers in SHJ, a low-temperatureesintering metal paste could be used, providing the possibility to reduce the cost by using scarce materials. Silver in the grid electrodes is going to be reduced or replaced by a base metal, such as Cu@Ag core-shell materials [155] or Cu with surface oxidation resistance [156]. Until 2021, the costs of TCO targets are still an important factor, which spend more than 10% of the consumable costs [7]. The main reason is the relatively high price of indium [26]. Hence, indium-free TCO materials, such as AZO [112,145], are also attempted to integrate into the SHJ solar cells. Compared with ITO, stability veriﬁed by industry and academia, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance since the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved issue. AZO ﬁlms still face challenges of relatively high resistivity [157,158]. Another possible approach would be using multilayered AR coatings such as SiOx [24], SiNx [118,119], and MgF2 [117] on top of extremely thin ITO layers. In this way, the usage of indium could be reduced while still maintaining low resistivity contact. For example, SHJ solar cells have the potential to achieve an excellent Jsc beyond 42 mA/cm2 if the front-side ITO layer can be replaced by an ITO/SiNx double layer [118,119]. 5. Summary and perspective Herein, we presented a comprehensive review covering all the aspects of TCO ﬁlms in the application of SHJ solar cells, from basic functions to materials, as well as their application in mass production. SHJ solar cells are a fundamental approach for accomplishing high-efﬁciency PV devices. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms act as literal conductive layers which connect the doped a-/mc-Si:H layers and the metal grids. As a fundamental role in the solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms have a key impact on PCEs and the production cost of the solar cell intensively. ITO materials are still the most widely applied TCOs in SHJ solar cells in mass production. But their relatively low carrier mobility of less than 40 cm/(Vs) is becoming a limiting factor to meet the continuous demand for elevating solar cell performance. Meanwhile, the high indium consumption of ITO ﬁlms hinders further reducing the production cost. Therefore, TCO materials, deposition techniques as well as PVD equipment should be further investigated for SHJ solar cells to enhance the performance and mitigate the cost. Here, we outline possible research approaches and challenges that have to be addressed for the future development of TCO ﬁlms. Development of high-mobility TCOs. In TCO ﬁlms, it is a tradeoff between the conductivity and the transparency via tuning Ne. While with the improvement of m, the conductivity of TCO ﬁlms could be enhanced without any losses in transmittance. Hence, the development of high-mobility (>100 cm2/(Vs)) TCO materials is highly required for the mass production of SHJ solar cells. Application of multilayered TCO structures. To deduct the rc of the TCO/doped a-Si:H and the TCO/Ag grid interfaces, the materials composite from the front to the rear side of TCO ﬁlms should be different. Consequently, multilayer structures, in which materials with different WFs or Ne, should be applied in TCO ﬁlms. Low-damage TCO coating methods. The PVD coating methods and processes to fabricate TCO ﬁlms play a signiﬁcant role on the passivation effect of the substrates. Therefore, the development of low-damage TCO coating equipment or processes that are suitable for mass production is indispensable for improving cell efﬁciency. Reduction of indium consumption. The high indium consumption of TCO ﬁlms is one of the detrimental factors that hinders the cost reduction of SHJ solar cells. To deduct the indium consumption or develop indium-free TCO ﬁlms, it is highly required to apply in SHJ solar cells. Meanwhile, the technique of deposition of an ARC on top of the TCO ﬁlms, which means shrinking the thickness of TCO ﬁlms, also should be applied in solar cells. Silicon solar cells can be manufactured, even at the TW scale, where the photoactive bulk silicon layer avoids any scarce materials, and the silver grid electrode is going to be substituted by base metals, such as copper. SHJ solar cells are going to be the predominant production in the market of Si-based PV devices in the future. As the key cost issues for the SHJ devices, the development of TCO ﬁlms still faces some challenges. We believe this review would prompt us to learn the achievements, remaining challenges, as well as possible investigation directions, and promote the development of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells rapidly.

Introduction The world market of photovoltaics (PV) is currently dominated by crystal silicon (c-Si)-based solar cells, which occupy a market share of approximately 95% in 2019 [1,2]. Amongst c-Si solar cells, aluminum back surface ﬁeld (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells (Fig. 1a), which are also named by homojunction c-Si solar cells, are predominating in large-scale industrial solar cell products (Fig. 1b). However, due to the high carrier recombination at the silicon surface, the values of the power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of Al-BSF cells and PERC cells are reaching their limitation, which are around 20% and 24% [3], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. Besides, the polysilicon-passivated junction technique, built by embedding a thin silicon oxide layer atop a c-Si substrate, also named tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), is emerging as a promising alternative. And a record PCE of 26.4% [4] has been achieved in TOPCon cells. As an alternative, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technique is an important approach for the next generation of highefﬁciency PV productions [1,6,7], as predicted in Fig. 1d. In the 1990s, Sanyo Co. invented the ﬁrst SHJ solar cell, which integrated a boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter with an n-type c-Si wafer and achieved a PCE close to 12% [8]. And then Sanyo Co. improved the PCE to 22.8% [9] and 23.7% [10] in 2009 and 2011, respectively, in which the carrier concentration of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms was reduced to mitigate free carrier absorption (FCA), while the Hall mobility was improved to optimize the lateral conductivity. In 2013, they further enhanced the PCE to 24.7% [11]. And then, the PCE of double-side SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% [12] on a large area device of 151.9 cm2 by Kaneka Co. in 2015 due to high ﬁll factor (FF) of 83%.

In 2022, SHJ solar cells based on transition metal doped indium oxide (IMO) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (m-Si:H) achieved a PCE of 25.26% [14]. And in the same year, Longi Co. raised the world-record PCE to 26.81% [15] for SHJ solar cells, approaching the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [16]. In recent years, several industry players joined the SHJ solar cell market. As predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic [2], SHJ cells are expected to gain a market share of about 10% in 2025, corresponding to a shipment of over 100 GW per year. In future mass manufacture, due to the relatively low temperatures in fabrication processes, SHJ solar cells can tolerate continually thinner c-Si thickness (up to 80 mm), which would exactly cater to the cost reduction for the PV industry. Due to the poor lateral conductivity of the doped a-Si:H layers in SHJ solar cells, the front and rear sides of the devices must be combined with transparent electrode layers to deliver the photogenerated charges to the terminals. Amongst all the materials for the transparent electrodes, TCOs are ideal candidates to meet the requirement. TCOs are intrinsically wide band-gap materials, typically metal oxides, that can be heavily doped and serve as transparent conductors for charge carrier extraction at the device terminals [17e22]. Since the 1960s and 1970s, TCOs have witnessed the revolutionary development of SHJ solar cells due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties [23e26]. Existing reviews on this topic either emphasize all aspects of SHJ solar cells or are out of date [1,7,27e29]. In other works, researchers reviewed the achievements and the challenges of TCO ﬁlms [30e32]. As TCOs are fundamental materials for SHJ solar cells, a systematic review of material selection, characterization, and gigawatt-scale production is essential but still lacking. This article reviews the general requirements and the status of the development of TCO ﬁlms targeting high-performance SHJ solar cells. In the ﬁrst section, we listed and discussed the relevant properties of TCO ﬁlms for the application in SHJ solar cells, including conductivity, transparency as well as contact resistance at the interfaces. Additionally, we also elucidated the inﬂuence factors and the control strategies for the passivation detrimental effect during the deposition of TCO ﬁlms. In the second section, we summarized the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells, focusing on their inﬂuence on work function (WF), resistivity, and transmittance on the performance of SHJ solar cells. In the third section, we presented the current state and developing trend of TCO ﬁlms in the industrialization of SHJ solar cells. 2. Application requirements of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells 2.1. Transparency, reﬂectance, and conductivity of TCO ﬁlms In SHJ solar cells, both optical and electrical properties are signiﬁcant for TCO ﬁlms. However, there is always a trade-off between these two properties. The improvement of the transparency of the Fig. 1.

(d) The schematic of silicon heterojunction solar cells. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 2 TCO ﬁlms always leads to the reduction of the conductivity, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the optical and electrical properties of TCO ﬁlms to achieve desirable performance in SHJ solar cells. As bifacial devices, the performance of SHJ solar cells is primarily inﬂuenced by the optical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, including transparency and antireﬂection (AR) properties, at both the front and rear sides. The transparency of the TCO ﬁlms is mainly determined by the band structure and the deposition condition [33]. For application in SHJ solar cells, the material should possess decent transmittance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. For this reason, typical metal oxides with a fundamental bandgap larger than 3 eV [33,34], including indium oxide (In2O3) [35], tin oxide (SnO2) [36,37], and zinc oxide (ZnO) [35,38], are widely applied in TCO ﬁlms. To improve their conductivity, the metal oxides are doped by other elements to shift the Fermi level into the conduction band, during which the free carrier concentration (Ne) in the oxides is improved. The transmittance toward the long wavelength region is tremendously affected by Ne. According to Drude theory, the plasma frequency u could be written as Equation (1) [39,40]: u2 ¼ e2$Ne ε0$εr$m* (1) where, e is the electric charge carried by a single electron, and ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. The plasma frequency deﬁned the onset of the FCA, thus the increase of Ne would reduce the transmittance of the TCO ﬁlms at a long wavelength range. Generally, TCO ﬁlms also act the role of AR coatings, which determines the thickness of the ﬁlms. The reﬂectance on the Si surface is minimized for one wavelength, which is given by Ref. [33]: dTCO ¼ l 4n (2) where, l is the wavelength at which the reﬂectance is minimized, n is the refractive index of the TCO ﬁlms at the wavelength, and dTCO is the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. Generally, to achieve the best PCE performance, the solar cell should present the lowest reﬂectance at the visible light range (400e760 nm), which determines the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. For example, for indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlms on the front side of the SHJ solar cells, the thickness is generally set at 70e80 nm since ITO exhibits an n of approximately 1.9 at the wavelength of 580 nm [41]. For the TCO ﬁlms on the rear sides, the thickness could be a bit larger to mitigate the sheet resistance (Rsheet) at the cost of reducing the PCE measured at the rear side (for bifacial cells). In SHJ solar cells, the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms determines the pitch of the metal grids. A decrease of Rsheet allows a larger pitch of the metal grid, which then beneﬁts the cell performance by reducing themetal shading area as well as improving lateral transportation. Since Rsheet is deﬁned as Rsheet ¼ r/dTCO, either reducing electrical resistivity (r) or accumulating dTCO enables Rsheet smaller. However, as discussed above, dTCO is determined mainly by the antireﬂectance performance. In the TCO ﬁlms, the relationships among resistivity r, Ne, and the carrier mobility (m) could be described as Equation (3) [42], r ¼ 1 eNem (3) Either the improvement of Ne or m leads to a decrease in r, which further reduces Rsheet and improves FF in solar cells. Most TCO materials are n-type semiconductors, and Ne of their ﬁlms is primarily determined by the dopant concentration in the host materials. Besides, Ne could also be tuned by deposition conditions, such as deposition power [43], the pressure of the chamber [44], partial pressure of oxygen [45e47] and water [48,49] etc, which results in a value of Ne in the range from 1019 to 1021 cm3 [50]. Since the increase of Ne degrades the transparency of the TCO ﬁlms in the visible and near-infrared region, the best strategy to reduce Rsheet is to increase m while limiting Ne. The m in n-type materials could be written as Equation (4) [33,51], m ¼ et m* (4) where, t is the relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band, respectively. Different scattering mechanisms caused by ionized impurities, neutral impurities, or gain boundaries have an impact on the relaxation time of the carriers in the TCO ﬁlms and decrease m [33,51]. For the ITO ﬁlms applied in SHJ solar cells, typical motilities are 20e40 cm2/(V$s) [35,52]. Therefore, as the aspect of the solar cell performance, it is a trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. The increase of Ne leads to an improvement in conductivity but a reduction in transparency, while the decrease results in a contrary result. To balance the optical and the electrical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, the ﬁgure of merit (FTC) is intruded to evaluate the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms on solar cell performance, which is deﬁned as Equation (5) [53]: FTC ¼ T10 avg Rsheet (5) With the Tavg the average of the transmittance of the ﬁlms. The larger FTC means a better compromise between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms, which leads to better performance of the solar cells. 2.2. Carrier transportation at TCO interfaces In the structure of SHJ solar cells, TCO ﬁlms connect the carrier selective layers and the metal electrodes, enabling the TCO ﬁlms important roles in carrier transportation at the interfaces. Amongst all the interfaces in SHJ solar cells, the carrier transportation at the TCO/doped a-Si:H interfaces has a critical contribution to the series resistivity losses [54,55]. To study the contact resistivity (rc) at the interfaces, the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts are generally considered as Schottky contacts, in which the carrier transportation is typically governed by the energy band alignment [56,57]. According to simulation results, the WF difference between the TCO ﬁlm and the a-Si:H layer has a strong inﬂuence on the contact resistance [58,59]. That means the WF requirements for the TCO ﬁlms of the electron contact (TCO/a-Si(n)) and the hole contact (TCO/a-Si(p)) are different. As reported by Ritzau et al. [56], as shown in Fig. 2a, for the ideal electron contacts, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be lower than 4.2 eV, which is close to the Fermi level of the a-Si:H(n) layers. While for the hole contacts at the TCO/a-Si:H(p) interfaces, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be higher than that of the a-Si:H(p) layers (~5.3 eV) [60]. However, the TCO materials applied in SHJ solar cells are typically n-type semiconductors with relatively low WFs, such as ITO (4.2e4.5eV) [36,37], aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) (3.4e4.5eV) [61], etc, which do not meet the requirements for the hole contacts. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the patterns with the aSi:H(p)/ITO or a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact exhibit lower open circuit voltages (VOCs) at high illumination intensity than the ones with a W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 3 high WF WOx layer, conﬁrming that large Schottky barriers are formed in the former contacts and hinder carrier transportation at the interfaces. To suppress rc of the hole contacts, high WF transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxides (MoOx) [61e63], tungsten oxides (WOx) [61,64,65], and vanadium oxides (VOx) [66], are integrated into SHJ solar cells as contact modiﬁcation layers. Regarding the a-Si:H(p) layers, a sufﬁciently high net doping concentration is necessary to optimize rc by avoiding the hole-selective layer from being depleted [55,67,68]. But the rising of the doping concentration burdens the defect densities in the a-Si:H layers [69,70], ﬁxing the effective net doping at a level below 1017 cm3. To realize this strategy, doped hydrogenated nano- or microcrystalSi (nc-Si:H [68,71] or mc-Si:H [14]) layers, in which the effective net doping level could be higher than 1019 cm3, are integrated into SHJ solar cells, alternating the doped a-Si:H layers. Zhao et al. reported SHJ solar cells with the nc-Si:H(p)/ITO contact and achieved low contact resistance (rc of 0.144 U,cm2) successfully [72]. As discussed above, the traditional transportation exploration at the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts is mainly based on direct tunneling (DT), which is highly dependent on energy alignment. While in recent works, besides the DT mode, indirect tunneling (IDT) modes, such as trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and band-to-band tunneling (B2BT), are taken into consideration as well in the simulation of charge carrier transportation at the hole and the electron contacts in SHJ solar cell. Fig. 3a and b show typical carrier transport processes based on the DT and IDT modes at the n- and the p-contact. At the n-contact, the carrier transportation is primarily dominated by the DT mode and supported by TAT mode partially. While at the p-contact, the IDT mode is the dominant one instead of the DT mode. Regarding carrier transportation by either DT or IDT, the charge Ne of TCO ﬁlms plays an important role. On the one hand, the increase of Ne leads to the decrease of the WFs of TCO ﬁlms [73], which beneﬁts DT at the electron contact but deteriorates the WF mismatch at the hole contact. On the other hand, larger Ne is beneﬁcial for IDT on both sides of the solar cells [70,73,74]. Therefore, large Ne in TCO ﬁlms is helpful to maintain low rc at the electron contact areas. While for the hole contacts, due to the WF mismatch, the carrier transportation at the interfaces is primarily determined by IDT but is also impacted by the energy alignment. So, appropriate Ne of the ITO ﬁlms is required for the hole contacts with small rc. In Fig. 3c, rc for the hole contacts is plotted against Ne of the TCO ﬁlms [70]. At the active energy (Ea) of the a-Si:H(p) layer at 275 meV, the lowest rc is located at Ne value of approximately 2 1020 cm3. When the Ne rises above this value, the rc slightly increases due to the WF mismatch, while the rc rises monotonically with the reducing Ne below 2 1020 cm3. The TCO/metal contacts on both sides of the SHJ solar cells are another important factor that should be taken into consideration. In the manufacture of SHJ solar cells, screen printing with lowtemperature sintering metal pastes is the most widely applied technique for metallization. During this process, silver (Ag) or silver-coated copper (Ag@Cu) pastes are printed on the TCO surfaces, and metal grid electrodes are formed after drying and sintering processes with temperatures less than 200 C. Generally, the rc of the TCO/silver grid contacts (rc, TCO/Ag) is primarily dominated by the Ne in TCO ﬁlms [75]. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO/metal contacts are always treated as Schottky contacts [75]. As a highly doped semiconductor (Ne > 1019 cm3), ﬁeld emission (FE) or thermionic ﬁeld emission (TFE) is the dominant transportation mode at the contact [75,76]. According to the Schottky metal/semiconductor junction theory, an increase in Ne in TCO ﬁlms leads to a thinner potential barrier at the TCO/metal interfaces. Hence, the chance of charge carrier tunneling through the barriers should be enhanced, and rc,TCO/Ag is reduced accordingly. As shown in Fig. 3d, Schube et al. proved that rc,ITO/Ag decreases with the increase of Ne in the ITO layers under similar printing and sintering conditions [77]. 2.3. Degradation of passivation during deposition of TCO ﬁlms In recent years, deposition techniques with less damage impact on the a-Si:H layers, such as reactive plasma deposition (RPD) [78], atom layer deposition (ALD) [79e81], and sputtering with mirror shape target conﬁguration [82,83], have been investigated to fabricate TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells. However, conventional pulsed or direct current magnetron sputtering is still the most widely used deposition technique in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, owing to their high deposition rates and scalability. During the sputtering of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated silicon substrate interacts withthe plasma intensively, and a signiﬁcant degradation occurs in the passivation interfaces, leading to a reduction of VOC and pseudo-FF in the solar cell performance [84]. The detrimental effect during sputtering primarily arises from ultraviolet (UV) light luminescence [85,86] in plasma and ion bombardment [87,88], including ion and neutral particles from plasma gas, sputtering targets, and their compounds [89]. And the passivation quality could be partially recovered after a high-temperature treatment during or after the TCO deposition process [84,86]. UV radiation is believed as a damage source for the a-Si: H passivation in SHJ solar cells for a long time [85,90,91]. During the deposition processes of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated Si substrates are under the illumination of plasma and damage occurs in the a-Si:H ﬁlms or at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces. In a-Si:H ﬁlms, the Fig. 2. (a) The simulated ﬁll factor as a function of the work function and a-Si:H doping (n/p type) [56]. (b) Patterns of Suns-VOC measurements (open circuit voltages measured with different illumination) of the p-contact at high illumination intensity (the inset is the respective structure in the measurements) [56]. Copyright 2014, Elsevier. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 4 binding energy of SieH and SieSi is approximately 3.6 eV [92] and 2.5 eV [93], respectively, which is in the UVevisible spectral range. After the illumination of UV light in plasma, the SieSi and the SieH bonds in a-Si:H(i) or a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are partially broken and then the passivation effect of the Si substrates is degraded [86]. B. Demaurex et al. show that the minority carrier lifetime (MCLT) of the a-Si:H passivated Si samples shielded with normal glasses (10% transparency at 4.7 eV) and quartz glasses (10% transparency at 7.8 eV) dropped 14% and 27% after sputtering, respectively, comparing with a value of 96% on bare samples without shielding [86]. It has been proven that the damage should be ascribed to plasma luminescence. During the plasma illuminating process, the surface recombination velocity of the samples would be degraded after a short exposure of 10 s and reach a saturation value after ~60 s [87]. It was interpreted that the UV light triggers the generation of fast metastable defects at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface in several seconds, and the reversible defects become saturated in a minute. Ion bombardment is the most critical part of the detrimental effects. During deposition, the MCLT losses of the passivated Si wafer could be more than 90%, as compared with that before deposition [43,84,86,94]. And merely part of the losses could be recovered after annealing. Generally, the detrimental effects of the particle bombardment are correlated with the thickness of the a-Si: H layer [95], the deposition conditions [89,96] as well as the deposition modes [84,97,98]. The a-Si:H layer with enough thickness enables the protection of the silicon wafer from any damage caused by bombardment during sputtering. However, due to the parasitic absorption [52] and the high resistive property [55,74], the increase of the a-Si:H layer can signiﬁcantly contribute to optical and series resistance losses in solar cells. As reported by L. Tutsch et al., the MCLTs of the wafers passivated with >7-nm-thick aSi:H(i) layers are almost fully restored after sputtering and after sputtering annealing, while the samples with 7-nm-thick passivation layers exhibit severe detrimental effects [95]. It is consistent with the thickness of a-Si:H stacks in SHJ solar cells, which lies approximately 10 nm [14]. Regarding deposition conditions, the degradation induced by ion bombardment could be suppressed by either decreasing the power applied to the targets or increasing the chamber pressure during sputtering [95]. The passivation degradation caused by ion bombardment should be correlated with either ion kinetic energy [99,100] or ion ﬂux [86,87]. Reduction of the power leads to a decrease of the current and voltage on the target, thereby lowing both the ion ﬂux and ion kinetic energy in the plasma deposition process [95]. On the other hand, the improvement of the chamber Fig. 3. The schematic band diagrams and carrier transport mechanisms for (a) the n-contact and (b) the p-contact [73].

L. Tutsch et al. utilized a thin ITO ﬁlm of several nanometers, which was deposited with relatively low power and high chamber pressure to protect the a-Si:H(i) layers-passivated Si wafer from the damage of ion bombardment [43]. As a result, the lifetime of the protected samples was improved by several folds, and their iVoc was enhanced for ~26 mV in comparison with the baseline samples. The comparison of passivation degradation among different sputtering modes, including radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), and pulsed DC modes, was summarized [84,97,98]. Due to the lower target voltage (RF: 112 V, DC: >200 V), RF sputtering exhibits less bombardmentinduced damage to the passivated substrates both after sputtering and recovering after annealing. Regardless of the damage sources in the TCO deposition process, the a-Si:H-based surface passivation can be recovered by 180e200 C thermal annealing either during or after the deposition [87,101,102]. During the thermal treatment process, the carrier concentration at the c-Si surface (band bending) would be tuned. It was reported that the surface defects in a-Si:H passivation layers can be eliminated after annealing at 180 C [101]. This effect is due to the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the a-Si:H(i) bulk toward dangling bonds at the c-Si surface, and the latter is then passivated by the formation of monohydrides. It is likely that the repassivation of dangling bonds, caused by the sputter-induced SieH bond rupture, follows the same principles. As reported by Demaurex et al. [86], the microstructural modiﬁcation in the a-Si:H layers after sputtering and annealing was investigated by a Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement. In this report, the authors showed that both monohydride and multihydride bonds in the a-Si:H layers were descended after sputtering, while the hydride bonds recovered partially after short annealing. 3. Classiﬁcation of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells Due to its superior photoelectric property and long-term stability, ITO is widely used in optoelectronic applications and has become the standard material for SHJ solar cells [1,7]. Meanwhile, the optoelectrical performance can be further improved by tuning the composition or interface modiﬁcation. To reduce the use of the rare indium element, it is an attractive way to ﬁnd low-cost substitutes with indium-based TCOs. AZO is a natively polycrystalline material with lower electronic quality than ITO when deposited at low temperatures (<200 C) and as a thin layer (<100 nm), making it an attractive low-cost substitute [31,103]. Indium-based oxides [45,98,104e108] and zinc-based oxides [109e115] are the most widely studied two TCO categories in SHJ solar cells. Each of them has its limitations. In this section, we attempt to review the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells and their performance in SHJ solar cells. 3.1. Doped indium oxides In recent years, indium-based TCOs have attracted wide attention and been reviewed, thanks to their high conductivity to ensure the transportation of photogenerated charges as well as outstanding transparency to the sun spectrum [19]. Despite the limited indium content in the earth's crust, various cation-doped In2O3 have been investigated so far in SHJ solar cells [24,25]. Indium oxide doped with hydrogen, tin, tungsten, cerium, etc. are commonly used TCO materials in SHJ cells. In the following part, roadmaps toward higher efﬁciency by using indium-based oxides as TCOs in SHJ solar cells would be discussed. 3.1.1. ITO Currently, more than 70% of indium is used in the production of ITO materials, which subsequently has broadly been applied as TCO ﬁlms in the production of industrial SHJ solar cells [24,25]. The relatively low resistivity, high transparency, and large-scale production capability make ITO well-suited for displaying the transport channel layer on both sides in SHJ solar cells. Additionally, long-time stability and facile production are other factors to contribute ITO as the dominant TCO electrodes. Consequently, continuous improvements in industrial PCE performance have been obtained, and the breakthrough efﬁciency of double-side contacted SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% in 2015 [12], a world record, surpassing the champion efﬁciency of homojunction PERC cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Kaneka Corp. published their work on IBCSHJ (structure as Fig. 4b) with the ﬁrst silicon solar cell exceeding a PCE of 26% with a FF of 83.8% [24]. Later in 2017, further progress in eliminating the parasitic absorption of a-Si:H layers by using IBC structures was reported to be a PCE of 26.7% [13]. A world-record PCE of 26.81% is achieved by LONGI Co. in 2022. However, compared with the theoretical PCE limit (close to the 28.5% theoretical ceiling predicted for a 1.1 eV band gap material), there is still a noticeable gap for the further development of ITO in SHJ solar cells in the coming years. Most notably, the PCE of current SHJ devices is limited by the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. Due to the relatively low carrier mobility, which is generally below 40 cm2/(Vs), ITO ﬁlms are not able to achieve high transparency and decent conductivity at the same time [1,21,24,117]. That tradeoff limits the improvement of the solar cell PCE. Moreover, the strategies of pattern processing structures or multilayer reﬂectors have been reported that do not balance the conﬂicting optical and electrical properties of ITO in SHJ devices [24,117e119], but any additional layers and processes might burden the cost and complexity for the cell fabrication process. Thus, the approach for developing new TCOs with high carrier mobility and low extinction coefﬁcient is necessary. 3.1.2. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) By alternating tin in ITO materials with hydrogen to form hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H), a high m of 100 cm2/(Vs) has been achieved. The IO:H ﬁlms exhibit extremely low solar-average absorption, coming in as one of the most ideal materials to replace ITO at the front side (Fig. 5a) [39,55,120,121e124]. By replacing the front ITO layer with IO:H, Koida et al. demonstrated a PCE of 16.1% for the SHJ solar cells [122]. A large-scale (153.4 cm2) device with a PCE of 21.13% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.18 mA/cm2 was exhibited, showing an obvious enhancement compared to the ITO counterparts (Fig. 5b) [125]. Indeed, the incorporation of the IO:H ﬁlms, instead of the conventional ITO ﬁlms, enhances the Jsc and the resulting PCE. The detailed analysis of the solar cells revealed that the appearance of hydrogen atoms as single-charged donors and their ability to passivate defects at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline ﬁlms led to the reduction of reﬂection loss at the IO:H/a-Si:H interface and less optical absorption in the IO:H layers [39,120,123,124]. Compared with ITO and IZO ﬁlms, the resulting IO:H ﬁlms feature both high carrier mobility (with the best value of 100 cm2/V$s) and large band gap values after annealing, which contribute to the Jsc of 39.18 mA/cm2 [125]. Compared with the ITO materials, IO:H suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the metal front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting an ITO layer between IO:H and Ag [120]. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, low Rsheet as well as small free-carrier absorption, outperforming the IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells (Fig. 5c) [120]. A remarkable PCE of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen- W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 6 printed SHJ solar cell was obtained by employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide. Nevertheless, copper plating was also investigated to reduce the expensive silver usage. A certiﬁed solar cell device with a PCE of 22.5% (FF of 80%) is demonstrated utilizing the combination of a-Si:H/MoOx, layers, IO:H ﬁlms, and copper-plated grids (Fig. 5d) [126]. These results demonstrate that IO:H is quite an attractive alternative to ITO for SHJ solar cells. 3.1.3. Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), the substitution of W6þ for In3þ, is a kind of TCO ﬁlm that can provide more carriers while reducing the defect concentration, compared to ITO ﬁlms [127]. IWO ﬁlms show high carrier mobility values of 50e80 cm2/(Vs) [19]. Beneﬁting from their high electron mobility, IWO layers not only yield low resistivity but also show high NIR transmittance (94.21% at a 80 nm thickness). Moreover, there are many Fig. 4.

Due to the high carrier mobility, IWO materials are integrated into SHJ solar cells as transparent electrode layers on both the front and the rear sides, reducing both Rsheet and FCA and leading to improved performances in the solar cells (Fig. 6a). In the early stage, to obtain appropriate carrier mobility above 60 cm2/(Vs), the deposition temperature was higher than 300 C for a long time [128]. However, this is contrary to the low process temperature requirement of SHJ solar cells. Subsequently, a series of low-temperature technologies were reported to adapt the application environment for SHJ solar cells, such as low-damage RPD or room-temperature sputtering technology [1,127e132]. Consequently, improved performances were achieved for the IWO-based SHJ solar cells to exceed 20% (Table 1). With the application of high-performance titanium and tungsten co-doped indium oxide ﬁlms, large-scale SHJ solar cells (243.34 cm2) with a high average PCE of 23.8% (with a Voc of 0.746 V, a Jsc of 38.7 mA/ cm2 and FF of 82.9%) were fabricated, in which the PCE was still lower than that for the record ITO-based SHJ solar cells yet [133]. Similar to the a-Si:H/ITO interface, the a-Si:H/IWO interfacial contact is also one of the crucial factors limiting the PCEs of the SHJ solar cells. A series of strategies are applied to optimize the Schottky barrier between p-a-Si:H and IWO. One approach is to apply MgF2 as a double-layer AR coating on top of the optimal device, the EQEintegrated Jsc was improved from 39.41 mA/cm2 to 40.16 mA/cm2 [128]. The ﬁnal 8.97-cm2 wide IWO/MgF2-based solar cell showed an active area cell efﬁciency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efﬁciency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b, Table 1) [128]. Additionally, the H diffusion from a-Si:H to tungsten-doped indium (IWOH) is reported to not only reduce the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms but also optimize the interfaces of a-Si:H/IWO [130]. The improved PCE of 22.3% for the IWOH-based solar cells was achieved on an average for 4cm2 SHJ cells, which have higher Jsc and PCEs than the IWO-based solar cell and similar FF [130]. Further, the prolonged hydrogen annealing process for the IWO-based solar cells gained the PCE by 1.14% to 23.31%, with a device area of 244.5 cm2 [129]. The aspect of electrical and optical properties, IWO is a desirable material for industrial SHJ solar cells, especially in solar cells with low-cost copper conductor grids [138]. A SHJ solar cell with copper as the metal grids and IWO as the transparent electrodes, which are fabricated in the lab and SIMIT's R&D line, reached a PCE of over 22%, showing great potential for the copper metallization of the SHJ solar cells with reduced cost and overcoming the limitations of screen-printing technology (Fig. 6c) [131]. By now, there is a consensus within the industrialization of IWO that the content of indium in the excellent performance of IWO (In:W ¼ 95:5) is still insufﬁciently ideal [128,129,137,133], where the high production costs would the pressing issue. In a word, IWO can provide advantages over ITO due to its lower absorption in the long wavelength region. However, there is still room for further improvement in conversion efﬁciency. Fig. 6.

Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 8 3.1.4. Alternative doped indium oxide To date, there are indium-based TCOs with other doping metals such as cerium, titanium, and zirconium, which mainly perform as front transparent electrodes for the solar cells having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region [78,125,139e141]. The large potential of the optimally processed In2O3:Ce:H (ICO:H) window layers in SHJ cells is demonstrated, quantiﬁed by the improvement in Jsc of 0.6 mA/cm2 without impairing the resistive losses in comparison to the usage of baseline ITO layers [139]. By further incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional ITO and IO:H ﬁlms, an improved PCE of 24.1%, a Voc of 745 mV, a Jsc of 38.8 mA/ cm2, and a FF of 83.2% were obtained [78]. It is believed that their high carrier mobility of 140 cm2/(V$s) contributed to their high efﬁciency. Already, SHJ solar cells with the optimized indium zirconium oxide (IZrO) front electrodes resulted in a Jsc of 40 mA/cm2, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 23.4% [141]. A heterojunction solar cell with an ITO/IZrO bilayer electrode succeeds in a Jsc of 38.72 mA/ cm2, a FF of 82.39%, and a PCE of up to 23.59% [140]. Similarly, the signiﬁcant reduction of the reﬂection loss of the conventional and needle-like Hf-doped In2O3 (IHFO) bilayer ﬁlms deposited on the textured silicon was observed. The short-circuit current and efﬁciency of the solar cell were improved by 0.52 mA/cm2 and 0.39%, utilizing a needle-like IHFO thin ﬁlm as an AR layer [134]. As for the manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells increases or future tandem devices, there are signiﬁcant concerns about the use of indium. The values of indium consumption per cell and per generated power for SHJ solar cells from different sources exhibited large discrepancies, but all available data indicate concern about the insufﬁcient supply of indium to support in the future [25]. Signiﬁcantly, reducing indium consumption for TCO ﬁlms has become mandatory to push SHJ solar cell technology toward a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. As an alternative to minimizing the use of metallic indium, thin indiumbased TCOs (with better performance) or the IBC cell design might be a choice. With a reduced thickness of approximately 30 nm for ITO layers, the resource-sustainable manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells would be substantially increased to 115e330 GW. However, this would only account for approximately 5e10% of a 3 TW market size, suggesting that the SHJ solar cell using ITO in some form remains a niche product. Moreover, reducing the thickness of ITO layers could also lead to signiﬁcant increases in rc due to the changes in current pathways and the current crowding effect. For example, 20-nm-thick ITO capped by a non-indiumbased TCO would greatly increase the sustainable manufacturing capacity compared to the present implementation for SHJ solar cells relying solely on ITO [25]. Thus, substituting part or full of ITO with a more transparent and less expensive dielectric indium-free ﬁlm is promising. 3.2. Doped zinc oxide Typically, an approximately 70-nm-thick ITO layer is used on each surface to form thin transparent conductive layers at the front and rear of the SHJ solar cells, corresponding to approximately 5.7 mg/W consumption of ITO and 4.2 mg/W consumption of indium, with an assumed cell PCE of 25.11% [25]. Thus, the future of cSi PVs would beneﬁt greatly from any alternative indium-free layer to circumvent the parasitic absorption in TCOs. As for the choice of indium-free TCOs in SHJ, AZOs, with low cost, abundant material reserves in nature and capability of achieving comparable efﬁciencies to the ITO-based SHJ solar cells, has been considered as one of the few potential alternatives to ITOs [109,142]. To reduce the use of indium, both ITO 50%/AZO 50% and ITO 25%/ AZO 50%/ITO 25% were used on the back of SHJ solar cells with a decent performance, which was close to that of individual ITO (Fig. 7a) [114]. The performance of the SHJ solar cells with such two kinds of TCO stacks as the back TCO layers was greatly improved compared to that with the individual AZO layer [114]. Meanwhile, the PCE gap between such the ITO/AZO stacks and the individual ITO stack could be narrowed to approximately 0.1% (absolute value), showing the possibility of applying the ITO/AZO stack structure in the SHJ solar cell [114]. Considering the use of indium-free TCOs, the AZO layers were used in three different cell conﬁgurations labeled as ‘front-AZO cell’, ‘back-AZO cell’. and ‘all-AZO cell’ [144]. At the early stage, it was found that the PCE was challenging to exceed 20% for the SHJ solar cells with the direct application of the individual AZO ﬁlm as a front-AZO cell (Table 2) [109,142]. For further improving the light coupling by textured AZO or the implementation of the electrochemically grown ZnO nanorod as AR layers on AZO, less discernible enhancement of the PCE was observed (Fig. 7b) [142]. Thanks to the optimization of experimental conditions for AZO, the abovementioned front AZO cell showed an overall increasing PCE of over 20% [143]. The low PCE was attributed to the poor contact of aSi:H(p)/AZO and the low electrical and optical properties of AZO. The optimized low-resistivity a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact by the implementation of a trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) doped a-Si:H(p) ﬁlm as a hole transport layer enables a FF above 81% and a PCE of 23.6% for the front-AZO SHJ solar cells, comparable with 23.7%-efﬁcient cells using traditional ITO (Fig. 7c) [143]. In addition, the back-AZO cell experienced a similar performance improvement path as that of the front-AZO cell. Featuring a standard screen-printed silver grid at the front with approximately 3.25% optical shadowing, a champion device of the black-AZO cell a Jsc of up to 40.81 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 23.96% was obtained [112]. As for all-AZO cells, a 4-cm2 cell was certiﬁed at ISFH CalTec with an efﬁciency of 23.0%, a VOC of 738.8 mV, a FF of 80.3%, and a JSC of 38.7 mA/cm2 [145].

W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 9 Furthermore, an all-AZO cell with a 244 cm2 total area reached a PCE as high as 21.3% by using an amorphous silicon oxide layer (aSiO2) as an AR coating. Thus far, AZO appeared to be a promising indium-free alternative material to replace the back ITO commonly used in SHJ solar cells. Remarkably, the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved problem [113,145]. Signiﬁcantly increasing electrical resistivity and surface degradation were obtained, when the AZO is exposed to a harsh environment (e.g. annealing in the air or humidity damping). Damp heat test results of encapsulated SHJ devices with AZO as the TCO ﬁlms exhibited relative FF degradation of 7% after 1000 h [145]. This drawback prevents AZO ﬁlms to be deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices. Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of effort still needs to be put into battle with the relatively poor conductivity and long-term stability of AZO layers. For example, the FF degradation rate might reduce with the deposition of a-SiO2 or SiNx under humid conditions [145]. However, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance. 3.3. Other TCOs Alternatively, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and graphene have also attracted attention [146e151]. Ag NWselectrodes can be deposited on top of the SHJ structure by mechanical transfer or solution technologies while achieving excellent transmittance and conductivity. However, Ag was reported to maintain low contact resistance between the silicon layer and metal, but it could easily react with a thin-ﬁlm silicon layer to form an insulating layer of AgO that blocks charge extraction. The issues remain to be tackled in the other metal-based TCOs, such as Ti, Cu, et al. [23] By inserting a SiNx layer to suppress the deterioration of the passivation quality of the Ti layer induced by direct metal-to-a-Si:H contacts, an indium-free design for SHJ solar cells achieve low series resistivity, a decent FF (80.7%), and efﬁciencies (>22%) [118]. Regarding graphene-based TCOs, until now, it is still arguable for use as a transparent electrode for any solar cell, since it would absorb signiﬁcantly over the full spectrum and shows large Rsheet [147]. 4. TCO ﬁlms for practical applications In mass production, rear-emitter (RE) structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n)/TCO/metal) are nowadays widely applied in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, taking the place of the traditional front emitter structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/TCO/metal) [7,14,152]. As discussed above , it is a trade-off between lateral conductivity and transparency in TCO ﬁlms. And in RE structures, by alternating the p/n junction with the high/low junction [32,152,153] at the front side, the lateral transport of the free carriers partially shifted from the TCO ﬁlms into the Si wafer, slightly decreasing the Rsheet. As a result, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties becomes less stringent at the front side [119,153]. Therefore, the requirements of the TCO ﬁlms for the front and the rear sides are different, depending on the structures of the SHJ solar cells. In RE structures, the requirement of the front side TCO ﬁlms is primarily on their optical properties rather than their electrical ones, which means low absorption and high carrier mobility but relatively low Fig. 7.

ITO materials have been widely applied as transparent electrodes, ever since the beginning of the SHJ solar cell development. It has been proven that the ratio of In:Sn played an important role in manipulating the carrier density, mobility, and transmittance of the ITO ﬁlms [59]. In SHJ solar cell mass production, 97/3-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 97/3) are chosen as the front TCO layers due to their excellent transparent capacity [154]. While 90/10-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 90/10) are integrated on the rear sides because of their low resistance [154]. With the improvement of PCEs of the SHJ solar cells, the relatively low carrier mobility of the ITO materials of less than 40 cm/(V$s) is gradually becoming a limiting factor, especially on the front side. Therefore, to improve the PCE of the SHJ solar cells, TCO materials with excellent transparency and high carrier mobility are introduced into the cells. Dong et al. [14]. selected a multidoped indium-based material IMO:H to enhance the charge mobility of the front TCO ﬁlms, and a certiﬁed PCE of 25.26% is accomplished. The IMO:H layers exhibited high carrier mobility of over 70 cm/(V$s) at a Ne of around 2 1020 cm3 and improved transmittance within below the 400-nm-wavelength range. Additionally, the IMO: H ﬁlms were also proven to possess lower rc with mc-Si:H(n). Besides the PCEs, the total cost of SHJ solar cell is also a critical obstacle to industrialization. Beneﬁting the uniquely indispensable TCO layers in SHJ, a low-temperatureesintering metal paste could be used, providing the possibility to reduce the cost by using scarce materials. Silver in the grid electrodes is going to be reduced or replaced by a base metal, such as Cu@Ag core-shell materials [155] or Cu with surface oxidation resistance [156]. Until 2021, the costs of TCO targets are still an important factor, which spend more than 10% of the consumable costs [7]. The main reason is the relatively high price of indium [26]. Hence, indium-free TCO materials, such as AZO [112,145], are also attempted to integrate into the SHJ solar cells. Compared with ITO, stability veriﬁed by industry and academia, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance since the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved issue. AZO ﬁlms still face challenges of relatively high resistivity [157,158]. Another possible approach would be using multilayered AR coatings such as SiOx [24], SiNx [118,119], and MgF2 [117] on top of extremely thin ITO layers. In this way, the usage of indium could be reduced while still maintaining low resistivity contact. For example, SHJ solar cells have the potential to achieve an excellent Jsc beyond 42 mA/cm2 if the front-side ITO layer can be replaced by an ITO/SiNx double layer [118,119]. 5. Summary and perspective Herein, we presented a comprehensive review covering all the aspects of TCO ﬁlms in the application of SHJ solar cells, from basic functions to materials, as well as their application in mass production. SHJ solar cells are a fundamental approach for accomplishing high-efﬁciency PV devices. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms act as literal conductive layers which connect the doped a-/mc-Si:H layers and the metal grids. As a fundamental role in the solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms have a key impact on PCEs and the production cost of the solar cell intensively. ITO materials are still the most widely applied TCOs in SHJ solar cells in mass production. But their relatively low carrier mobility of less than 40 cm/(Vs) is becoming a limiting factor to meet the continuous demand for elevating solar cell performance. Meanwhile, the high indium consumption of ITO ﬁlms hinders further reducing the production cost. Therefore, TCO materials, deposition techniques as well as PVD equipment should be further investigated for SHJ solar cells to enhance the performance and mitigate the cost. Here, we outline possible research approaches and challenges that have to be addressed for the future development of TCO ﬁlms. Development of high-mobility TCOs. In TCO ﬁlms, it is a tradeoff between the conductivity and the transparency via tuning Ne. While with the improvement of m, the conductivity of TCO ﬁlms could be enhanced without any losses in transmittance. Hence, the development of high-mobility (>100 cm2/(Vs)) TCO materials is highly required for the mass production of SHJ solar cells. Application of multilayered TCO structures. To deduct the rc of the TCO/doped a-Si:H and the TCO/Ag grid interfaces, the materials composite from the front to the rear side of TCO ﬁlms should be different. Consequently, multilayer structures, in which materials with different WFs or Ne, should be applied in TCO ﬁlms. Low-damage TCO coating methods. The PVD coating methods and processes to fabricate TCO ﬁlms play a signiﬁcant role on the passivation effect of the substrates. Therefore, the development of low-damage TCO coating equipment or processes that are suitable for mass production is indispensable for improving cell efﬁciency. Reduction of indium consumption. The high indium consumption of TCO ﬁlms is one of the detrimental factors that hinders the cost reduction of SHJ solar cells. To deduct the indium consumption or develop indium-free TCO ﬁlms, it is highly required to apply in SHJ solar cells. Meanwhile, the technique of deposition of an ARC on top of the TCO ﬁlms, which means shrinking the thickness of TCO ﬁlms, also should be applied in solar cells. Silicon solar cells can be manufactured, even at the TW scale, where the photoactive bulk silicon layer avoids any scarce materials, and the silver grid electrode is going to be substituted by base metals, such as copper. SHJ solar cells are going to be the predominant production in the market of Si-based PV devices in the future. As the key cost issues for the SHJ devices, the development of TCO ﬁlms still faces some challenges. We believe this review would prompt us to learn the achievements, remaining challenges, as well as possible investigation directions, and promote the development of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells rapidly.

Introduction The world market of photovoltaics (PV) is currently dominated by crystal silicon (c-Si)-based solar cells, which occupy a market share of approximately 95% in 2019 [1,2]. Amongst c-Si solar cells, aluminum back surface ﬁeld (Al-BSF) cells and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells (Fig. 1a), which are also named by homojunction c-Si solar cells, are predominating in large-scale industrial solar cell products (Fig. 1b). However, due to the high carrier recombination at the silicon surface, the values of the power conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of Al-BSF cells and PERC cells are reaching their limitation, which are around 20% and 24% [3], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c. Besides, the polysilicon-passivated junction technique, built by embedding a thin silicon oxide layer atop a c-Si substrate, also named tunneling oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), is emerging as a promising alternative. And a record PCE of 26.4% [4] has been achieved in TOPCon cells. As an alternative, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technique is an important approach for the next generation of highefﬁciency PV productions [1,6,7], as predicted in Fig. 1d. In the 1990s, Sanyo Co. invented the ﬁrst SHJ solar cell, which integrated a boron-doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) emitter with an n-type c-Si wafer and achieved a PCE close to 12% [8]. And then Sanyo Co. improved the PCE to 22.8% [9] and 23.7% [10] in 2009 and 2011, respectively, in which the carrier concentration of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) ﬁlms was reduced to mitigate free carrier absorption (FCA), while the Hall mobility was improved to optimize the lateral conductivity. In 2013, they further enhanced the PCE to 24.7% [11]. And then, the PCE of double-side SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% [12] on a large area device of 151.9 cm2 by Kaneka Co. in 2015 due to high ﬁll factor (FF) of 83%.

In 2022, SHJ solar cells based on transition metal doped indium oxide (IMO) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (m-Si:H) achieved a PCE of 25.26% [14]. And in the same year, Longi Co. raised the world-record PCE to 26.81% [15] for SHJ solar cells, approaching the fundamental limit of single junction Si solar cells (29.4%) [16]. In recent years, several industry players joined the SHJ solar cell market. As predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic [2], SHJ cells are expected to gain a market share of about 10% in 2025, corresponding to a shipment of over 100 GW per year. In future mass manufacture, due to the relatively low temperatures in fabrication processes, SHJ solar cells can tolerate continually thinner c-Si thickness (up to 80 mm), which would exactly cater to the cost reduction for the PV industry. Due to the poor lateral conductivity of the doped a-Si:H layers in SHJ solar cells, the front and rear sides of the devices must be combined with transparent electrode layers to deliver the photogenerated charges to the terminals. Amongst all the materials for the transparent electrodes, TCOs are ideal candidates to meet the requirement. TCOs are intrinsically wide band-gap materials, typically metal oxides, that can be heavily doped and serve as transparent conductors for charge carrier extraction at the device terminals [17e22]. Since the 1960s and 1970s, TCOs have witnessed the revolutionary development of SHJ solar cells due to their outstanding electronic and optical properties [23e26]. Existing reviews on this topic either emphasize all aspects of SHJ solar cells or are out of date [1,7,27e29]. In other works, researchers reviewed the achievements and the challenges of TCO ﬁlms [30e32]. As TCOs are fundamental materials for SHJ solar cells, a systematic review of material selection, characterization, and gigawatt-scale production is essential but still lacking. This article reviews the general requirements and the status of the development of TCO ﬁlms targeting high-performance SHJ solar cells. In the ﬁrst section, we listed and discussed the relevant properties of TCO ﬁlms for the application in SHJ solar cells, including conductivity, transparency as well as contact resistance at the interfaces. Additionally, we also elucidated the inﬂuence factors and the control strategies for the passivation detrimental effect during the deposition of TCO ﬁlms. In the second section, we summarized the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells, focusing on their inﬂuence on work function (WF), resistivity, and transmittance on the performance of SHJ solar cells. In the third section, we presented the current state and developing trend of TCO ﬁlms in the industrialization of SHJ solar cells. 2. Application requirements of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells 2.1. Transparency, reﬂectance, and conductivity of TCO ﬁlms In SHJ solar cells, both optical and electrical properties are signiﬁcant for TCO ﬁlms. However, there is always a trade-off between these two properties. The improvement of the transparency of the Fig. 1.

(d) The schematic of silicon heterojunction solar cells. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 2 TCO ﬁlms always leads to the reduction of the conductivity, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to make a balance between the optical and electrical properties of TCO ﬁlms to achieve desirable performance in SHJ solar cells. As bifacial devices, the performance of SHJ solar cells is primarily inﬂuenced by the optical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, including transparency and antireﬂection (AR) properties, at both the front and rear sides. The transparency of the TCO ﬁlms is mainly determined by the band structure and the deposition condition [33]. For application in SHJ solar cells, the material should possess decent transmittance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. For this reason, typical metal oxides with a fundamental bandgap larger than 3 eV [33,34], including indium oxide (In2O3) [35], tin oxide (SnO2) [36,37], and zinc oxide (ZnO) [35,38], are widely applied in TCO ﬁlms. To improve their conductivity, the metal oxides are doped by other elements to shift the Fermi level into the conduction band, during which the free carrier concentration (Ne) in the oxides is improved. The transmittance toward the long wavelength region is tremendously affected by Ne. According to Drude theory, the plasma frequency u could be written as Equation (1) [39,40]: u2 ¼ e2$Ne ε0$εr$m* (1) where, e is the electric charge carried by a single electron, and ε0 and εr are the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. The plasma frequency deﬁned the onset of the FCA, thus the increase of Ne would reduce the transmittance of the TCO ﬁlms at a long wavelength range. Generally, TCO ﬁlms also act the role of AR coatings, which determines the thickness of the ﬁlms. The reﬂectance on the Si surface is minimized for one wavelength, which is given by Ref. [33]: dTCO ¼ l 4n (2) where, l is the wavelength at which the reﬂectance is minimized, n is the refractive index of the TCO ﬁlms at the wavelength, and dTCO is the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. Generally, to achieve the best PCE performance, the solar cell should present the lowest reﬂectance at the visible light range (400e760 nm), which determines the thickness of the TCO ﬁlms. For example, for indium tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlms on the front side of the SHJ solar cells, the thickness is generally set at 70e80 nm since ITO exhibits an n of approximately 1.9 at the wavelength of 580 nm [41]. For the TCO ﬁlms on the rear sides, the thickness could be a bit larger to mitigate the sheet resistance (Rsheet) at the cost of reducing the PCE measured at the rear side (for bifacial cells). In SHJ solar cells, the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms determines the pitch of the metal grids. A decrease of Rsheet allows a larger pitch of the metal grid, which then beneﬁts the cell performance by reducing themetal shading area as well as improving lateral transportation. Since Rsheet is deﬁned as Rsheet ¼ r/dTCO, either reducing electrical resistivity (r) or accumulating dTCO enables Rsheet smaller. However, as discussed above, dTCO is determined mainly by the antireﬂectance performance. In the TCO ﬁlms, the relationships among resistivity r, Ne, and the carrier mobility (m) could be described as Equation (3) [42], r ¼ 1 eNem (3) Either the improvement of Ne or m leads to a decrease in r, which further reduces Rsheet and improves FF in solar cells. Most TCO materials are n-type semiconductors, and Ne of their ﬁlms is primarily determined by the dopant concentration in the host materials. Besides, Ne could also be tuned by deposition conditions, such as deposition power [43], the pressure of the chamber [44], partial pressure of oxygen [45e47] and water [48,49] etc, which results in a value of Ne in the range from 1019 to 1021 cm3 [50]. Since the increase of Ne degrades the transparency of the TCO ﬁlms in the visible and near-infrared region, the best strategy to reduce Rsheet is to increase m while limiting Ne. The m in n-type materials could be written as Equation (4) [33,51], m ¼ et m* (4) where, t is the relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band, respectively. Different scattering mechanisms caused by ionized impurities, neutral impurities, or gain boundaries have an impact on the relaxation time of the carriers in the TCO ﬁlms and decrease m [33,51]. For the ITO ﬁlms applied in SHJ solar cells, typical motilities are 20e40 cm2/(V$s) [35,52]. Therefore, as the aspect of the solar cell performance, it is a trade-off between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. The increase of Ne leads to an improvement in conductivity but a reduction in transparency, while the decrease results in a contrary result. To balance the optical and the electrical properties of the TCO ﬁlms, the ﬁgure of merit (FTC) is intruded to evaluate the inﬂuence of the ﬁlms on solar cell performance, which is deﬁned as Equation (5) [53]: FTC ¼ T10 avg Rsheet (5) With the Tavg the average of the transmittance of the ﬁlms. The larger FTC means a better compromise between the transparency and the conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms, which leads to better performance of the solar cells. 2.2. Carrier transportation at TCO interfaces In the structure of SHJ solar cells, TCO ﬁlms connect the carrier selective layers and the metal electrodes, enabling the TCO ﬁlms important roles in carrier transportation at the interfaces. Amongst all the interfaces in SHJ solar cells, the carrier transportation at the TCO/doped a-Si:H interfaces has a critical contribution to the series resistivity losses [54,55]. To study the contact resistivity (rc) at the interfaces, the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts are generally considered as Schottky contacts, in which the carrier transportation is typically governed by the energy band alignment [56,57]. According to simulation results, the WF difference between the TCO ﬁlm and the a-Si:H layer has a strong inﬂuence on the contact resistance [58,59]. That means the WF requirements for the TCO ﬁlms of the electron contact (TCO/a-Si(n)) and the hole contact (TCO/a-Si(p)) are different. As reported by Ritzau et al. [56], as shown in Fig. 2a, for the ideal electron contacts, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be lower than 4.2 eV, which is close to the Fermi level of the a-Si:H(n) layers. While for the hole contacts at the TCO/a-Si:H(p) interfaces, the WF of the TCO ﬁlms should be higher than that of the a-Si:H(p) layers (~5.3 eV) [60]. However, the TCO materials applied in SHJ solar cells are typically n-type semiconductors with relatively low WFs, such as ITO (4.2e4.5eV) [36,37], aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) (3.4e4.5eV) [61], etc, which do not meet the requirements for the hole contacts. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the patterns with the aSi:H(p)/ITO or a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact exhibit lower open circuit voltages (VOCs) at high illumination intensity than the ones with a W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 3 high WF WOx layer, conﬁrming that large Schottky barriers are formed in the former contacts and hinder carrier transportation at the interfaces. To suppress rc of the hole contacts, high WF transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxides (MoOx) [61e63], tungsten oxides (WOx) [61,64,65], and vanadium oxides (VOx) [66], are integrated into SHJ solar cells as contact modiﬁcation layers. Regarding the a-Si:H(p) layers, a sufﬁciently high net doping concentration is necessary to optimize rc by avoiding the hole-selective layer from being depleted [55,67,68]. But the rising of the doping concentration burdens the defect densities in the a-Si:H layers [69,70], ﬁxing the effective net doping at a level below 1017 cm3. To realize this strategy, doped hydrogenated nano- or microcrystalSi (nc-Si:H [68,71] or mc-Si:H [14]) layers, in which the effective net doping level could be higher than 1019 cm3, are integrated into SHJ solar cells, alternating the doped a-Si:H layers. Zhao et al. reported SHJ solar cells with the nc-Si:H(p)/ITO contact and achieved low contact resistance (rc of 0.144 U,cm2) successfully [72]. As discussed above, the traditional transportation exploration at the TCO/doped a-Si:H contacts is mainly based on direct tunneling (DT), which is highly dependent on energy alignment. While in recent works, besides the DT mode, indirect tunneling (IDT) modes, such as trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) and band-to-band tunneling (B2BT), are taken into consideration as well in the simulation of charge carrier transportation at the hole and the electron contacts in SHJ solar cell. Fig. 3a and b show typical carrier transport processes based on the DT and IDT modes at the n- and the p-contact. At the n-contact, the carrier transportation is primarily dominated by the DT mode and supported by TAT mode partially. While at the p-contact, the IDT mode is the dominant one instead of the DT mode. Regarding carrier transportation by either DT or IDT, the charge Ne of TCO ﬁlms plays an important role. On the one hand, the increase of Ne leads to the decrease of the WFs of TCO ﬁlms [73], which beneﬁts DT at the electron contact but deteriorates the WF mismatch at the hole contact. On the other hand, larger Ne is beneﬁcial for IDT on both sides of the solar cells [70,73,74]. Therefore, large Ne in TCO ﬁlms is helpful to maintain low rc at the electron contact areas. While for the hole contacts, due to the WF mismatch, the carrier transportation at the interfaces is primarily determined by IDT but is also impacted by the energy alignment. So, appropriate Ne of the ITO ﬁlms is required for the hole contacts with small rc. In Fig. 3c, rc for the hole contacts is plotted against Ne of the TCO ﬁlms [70]. At the active energy (Ea) of the a-Si:H(p) layer at 275 meV, the lowest rc is located at Ne value of approximately 2 1020 cm3. When the Ne rises above this value, the rc slightly increases due to the WF mismatch, while the rc rises monotonically with the reducing Ne below 2 1020 cm3. The TCO/metal contacts on both sides of the SHJ solar cells are another important factor that should be taken into consideration. In the manufacture of SHJ solar cells, screen printing with lowtemperature sintering metal pastes is the most widely applied technique for metallization. During this process, silver (Ag) or silver-coated copper (Ag@Cu) pastes are printed on the TCO surfaces, and metal grid electrodes are formed after drying and sintering processes with temperatures less than 200 C. Generally, the rc of the TCO/silver grid contacts (rc, TCO/Ag) is primarily dominated by the Ne in TCO ﬁlms [75]. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO/metal contacts are always treated as Schottky contacts [75]. As a highly doped semiconductor (Ne > 1019 cm3), ﬁeld emission (FE) or thermionic ﬁeld emission (TFE) is the dominant transportation mode at the contact [75,76]. According to the Schottky metal/semiconductor junction theory, an increase in Ne in TCO ﬁlms leads to a thinner potential barrier at the TCO/metal interfaces. Hence, the chance of charge carrier tunneling through the barriers should be enhanced, and rc,TCO/Ag is reduced accordingly. As shown in Fig. 3d, Schube et al. proved that rc,ITO/Ag decreases with the increase of Ne in the ITO layers under similar printing and sintering conditions [77]. 2.3. Degradation of passivation during deposition of TCO ﬁlms In recent years, deposition techniques with less damage impact on the a-Si:H layers, such as reactive plasma deposition (RPD) [78], atom layer deposition (ALD) [79e81], and sputtering with mirror shape target conﬁguration [82,83], have been investigated to fabricate TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells. However, conventional pulsed or direct current magnetron sputtering is still the most widely used deposition technique in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, owing to their high deposition rates and scalability. During the sputtering of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated silicon substrate interacts withthe plasma intensively, and a signiﬁcant degradation occurs in the passivation interfaces, leading to a reduction of VOC and pseudo-FF in the solar cell performance [84]. The detrimental effect during sputtering primarily arises from ultraviolet (UV) light luminescence [85,86] in plasma and ion bombardment [87,88], including ion and neutral particles from plasma gas, sputtering targets, and their compounds [89]. And the passivation quality could be partially recovered after a high-temperature treatment during or after the TCO deposition process [84,86]. UV radiation is believed as a damage source for the a-Si: H passivation in SHJ solar cells for a long time [85,90,91]. During the deposition processes of TCO ﬁlms, the a-Si:H passivated Si substrates are under the illumination of plasma and damage occurs in the a-Si:H ﬁlms or at the a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces. In a-Si:H ﬁlms, the Fig. 2. (a) The simulated ﬁll factor as a function of the work function and a-Si:H doping (n/p type) [56]. (b) Patterns of Suns-VOC measurements (open circuit voltages measured with different illumination) of the p-contact at high illumination intensity (the inset is the respective structure in the measurements) [56]. Copyright 2014, Elsevier. W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 4 binding energy of SieH and SieSi is approximately 3.6 eV [92] and 2.5 eV [93], respectively, which is in the UVevisible spectral range. After the illumination of UV light in plasma, the SieSi and the SieH bonds in a-Si:H(i) or a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are partially broken and then the passivation effect of the Si substrates is degraded [86]. B. Demaurex et al. show that the minority carrier lifetime (MCLT) of the a-Si:H passivated Si samples shielded with normal glasses (10% transparency at 4.7 eV) and quartz glasses (10% transparency at 7.8 eV) dropped 14% and 27% after sputtering, respectively, comparing with a value of 96% on bare samples without shielding [86]. It has been proven that the damage should be ascribed to plasma luminescence. During the plasma illuminating process, the surface recombination velocity of the samples would be degraded after a short exposure of 10 s and reach a saturation value after ~60 s [87]. It was interpreted that the UV light triggers the generation of fast metastable defects at the a-Si: H/c-Si interface in several seconds, and the reversible defects become saturated in a minute. Ion bombardment is the most critical part of the detrimental effects. During deposition, the MCLT losses of the passivated Si wafer could be more than 90%, as compared with that before deposition [43,84,86,94]. And merely part of the losses could be recovered after annealing. Generally, the detrimental effects of the particle bombardment are correlated with the thickness of the a-Si: H layer [95], the deposition conditions [89,96] as well as the deposition modes [84,97,98]. The a-Si:H layer with enough thickness enables the protection of the silicon wafer from any damage caused by bombardment during sputtering. However, due to the parasitic absorption [52] and the high resistive property [55,74], the increase of the a-Si:H layer can signiﬁcantly contribute to optical and series resistance losses in solar cells. As reported by L. Tutsch et al., the MCLTs of the wafers passivated with >7-nm-thick aSi:H(i) layers are almost fully restored after sputtering and after sputtering annealing, while the samples with 7-nm-thick passivation layers exhibit severe detrimental effects [95]. It is consistent with the thickness of a-Si:H stacks in SHJ solar cells, which lies approximately 10 nm [14]. Regarding deposition conditions, the degradation induced by ion bombardment could be suppressed by either decreasing the power applied to the targets or increasing the chamber pressure during sputtering [95]. The passivation degradation caused by ion bombardment should be correlated with either ion kinetic energy [99,100] or ion ﬂux [86,87]. Reduction of the power leads to a decrease of the current and voltage on the target, thereby lowing both the ion ﬂux and ion kinetic energy in the plasma deposition process [95]. On the other hand, the improvement of the chamber Fig. 3. The schematic band diagrams and carrier transport mechanisms for (a) the n-contact and (b) the p-contact [73].

L. Tutsch et al. utilized a thin ITO ﬁlm of several nanometers, which was deposited with relatively low power and high chamber pressure to protect the a-Si:H(i) layers-passivated Si wafer from the damage of ion bombardment [43]. As a result, the lifetime of the protected samples was improved by several folds, and their iVoc was enhanced for ~26 mV in comparison with the baseline samples. The comparison of passivation degradation among different sputtering modes, including radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), and pulsed DC modes, was summarized [84,97,98]. Due to the lower target voltage (RF: 112 V, DC: >200 V), RF sputtering exhibits less bombardmentinduced damage to the passivated substrates both after sputtering and recovering after annealing. Regardless of the damage sources in the TCO deposition process, the a-Si:H-based surface passivation can be recovered by 180e200 C thermal annealing either during or after the deposition [87,101,102]. During the thermal treatment process, the carrier concentration at the c-Si surface (band bending) would be tuned. It was reported that the surface defects in a-Si:H passivation layers can be eliminated after annealing at 180 C [101]. This effect is due to the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the a-Si:H(i) bulk toward dangling bonds at the c-Si surface, and the latter is then passivated by the formation of monohydrides. It is likely that the repassivation of dangling bonds, caused by the sputter-induced SieH bond rupture, follows the same principles. As reported by Demaurex et al. [86], the microstructural modiﬁcation in the a-Si:H layers after sputtering and annealing was investigated by a Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement. In this report, the authors showed that both monohydride and multihydride bonds in the a-Si:H layers were descended after sputtering, while the hydride bonds recovered partially after short annealing. 3. Classiﬁcation of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells Due to its superior photoelectric property and long-term stability, ITO is widely used in optoelectronic applications and has become the standard material for SHJ solar cells [1,7]. Meanwhile, the optoelectrical performance can be further improved by tuning the composition or interface modiﬁcation. To reduce the use of the rare indium element, it is an attractive way to ﬁnd low-cost substitutes with indium-based TCOs. AZO is a natively polycrystalline material with lower electronic quality than ITO when deposited at low temperatures (<200 C) and as a thin layer (<100 nm), making it an attractive low-cost substitute [31,103]. Indium-based oxides [45,98,104e108] and zinc-based oxides [109e115] are the most widely studied two TCO categories in SHJ solar cells. Each of them has its limitations. In this section, we attempt to review the application of various TCOs in the ﬁeld of SHJ solar cells and their performance in SHJ solar cells. 3.1. Doped indium oxides In recent years, indium-based TCOs have attracted wide attention and been reviewed, thanks to their high conductivity to ensure the transportation of photogenerated charges as well as outstanding transparency to the sun spectrum [19]. Despite the limited indium content in the earth's crust, various cation-doped In2O3 have been investigated so far in SHJ solar cells [24,25]. Indium oxide doped with hydrogen, tin, tungsten, cerium, etc. are commonly used TCO materials in SHJ cells. In the following part, roadmaps toward higher efﬁciency by using indium-based oxides as TCOs in SHJ solar cells would be discussed. 3.1.1. ITO Currently, more than 70% of indium is used in the production of ITO materials, which subsequently has broadly been applied as TCO ﬁlms in the production of industrial SHJ solar cells [24,25]. The relatively low resistivity, high transparency, and large-scale production capability make ITO well-suited for displaying the transport channel layer on both sides in SHJ solar cells. Additionally, long-time stability and facile production are other factors to contribute ITO as the dominant TCO electrodes. Consequently, continuous improvements in industrial PCE performance have been obtained, and the breakthrough efﬁciency of double-side contacted SHJ solar cells reached 25.1% in 2015 [12], a world record, surpassing the champion efﬁciency of homojunction PERC cells (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Kaneka Corp. published their work on IBCSHJ (structure as Fig. 4b) with the ﬁrst silicon solar cell exceeding a PCE of 26% with a FF of 83.8% [24]. Later in 2017, further progress in eliminating the parasitic absorption of a-Si:H layers by using IBC structures was reported to be a PCE of 26.7% [13]. A world-record PCE of 26.81% is achieved by LONGI Co. in 2022. However, compared with the theoretical PCE limit (close to the 28.5% theoretical ceiling predicted for a 1.1 eV band gap material), there is still a noticeable gap for the further development of ITO in SHJ solar cells in the coming years. Most notably, the PCE of current SHJ devices is limited by the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of the TCO ﬁlms. Due to the relatively low carrier mobility, which is generally below 40 cm2/(Vs), ITO ﬁlms are not able to achieve high transparency and decent conductivity at the same time [1,21,24,117]. That tradeoff limits the improvement of the solar cell PCE. Moreover, the strategies of pattern processing structures or multilayer reﬂectors have been reported that do not balance the conﬂicting optical and electrical properties of ITO in SHJ devices [24,117e119], but any additional layers and processes might burden the cost and complexity for the cell fabrication process. Thus, the approach for developing new TCOs with high carrier mobility and low extinction coefﬁcient is necessary. 3.1.2. Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) By alternating tin in ITO materials with hydrogen to form hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H), a high m of 100 cm2/(Vs) has been achieved. The IO:H ﬁlms exhibit extremely low solar-average absorption, coming in as one of the most ideal materials to replace ITO at the front side (Fig. 5a) [39,55,120,121e124]. By replacing the front ITO layer with IO:H, Koida et al. demonstrated a PCE of 16.1% for the SHJ solar cells [122]. A large-scale (153.4 cm2) device with a PCE of 21.13% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.18 mA/cm2 was exhibited, showing an obvious enhancement compared to the ITO counterparts (Fig. 5b) [125]. Indeed, the incorporation of the IO:H ﬁlms, instead of the conventional ITO ﬁlms, enhances the Jsc and the resulting PCE. The detailed analysis of the solar cells revealed that the appearance of hydrogen atoms as single-charged donors and their ability to passivate defects at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline ﬁlms led to the reduction of reﬂection loss at the IO:H/a-Si:H interface and less optical absorption in the IO:H layers [39,120,123,124]. Compared with ITO and IZO ﬁlms, the resulting IO:H ﬁlms feature both high carrier mobility (with the best value of 100 cm2/V$s) and large band gap values after annealing, which contribute to the Jsc of 39.18 mA/cm2 [125]. Compared with the ITO materials, IO:H suffers from high contact resistance at the interface of the IO:H layer and the metal front electrode grid. This problem is avoided by inserting an ITO layer between IO:H and Ag [120]. Such IO:H/ITO bilayers have low contact resistance, low Rsheet as well as small free-carrier absorption, outperforming the IO:H-only or ITO-only layers in solar cells (Fig. 5c) [120]. A remarkable PCE of 22.1% for a 4-cm2 screen- W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 6 printed SHJ solar cell was obtained by employing an IO:H/ITO bilayer as the front transparent conductive oxide. Nevertheless, copper plating was also investigated to reduce the expensive silver usage. A certiﬁed solar cell device with a PCE of 22.5% (FF of 80%) is demonstrated utilizing the combination of a-Si:H/MoOx, layers, IO:H ﬁlms, and copper-plated grids (Fig. 5d) [126]. These results demonstrate that IO:H is quite an attractive alternative to ITO for SHJ solar cells. 3.1.3. Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) Tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), the substitution of W6þ for In3þ, is a kind of TCO ﬁlm that can provide more carriers while reducing the defect concentration, compared to ITO ﬁlms [127]. IWO ﬁlms show high carrier mobility values of 50e80 cm2/(Vs) [19]. Beneﬁting from their high electron mobility, IWO layers not only yield low resistivity but also show high NIR transmittance (94.21% at a 80 nm thickness). Moreover, there are many Fig. 4.

Due to the high carrier mobility, IWO materials are integrated into SHJ solar cells as transparent electrode layers on both the front and the rear sides, reducing both Rsheet and FCA and leading to improved performances in the solar cells (Fig. 6a). In the early stage, to obtain appropriate carrier mobility above 60 cm2/(Vs), the deposition temperature was higher than 300 C for a long time [128]. However, this is contrary to the low process temperature requirement of SHJ solar cells. Subsequently, a series of low-temperature technologies were reported to adapt the application environment for SHJ solar cells, such as low-damage RPD or room-temperature sputtering technology [1,127e132]. Consequently, improved performances were achieved for the IWO-based SHJ solar cells to exceed 20% (Table 1). With the application of high-performance titanium and tungsten co-doped indium oxide ﬁlms, large-scale SHJ solar cells (243.34 cm2) with a high average PCE of 23.8% (with a Voc of 0.746 V, a Jsc of 38.7 mA/ cm2 and FF of 82.9%) were fabricated, in which the PCE was still lower than that for the record ITO-based SHJ solar cells yet [133]. Similar to the a-Si:H/ITO interface, the a-Si:H/IWO interfacial contact is also one of the crucial factors limiting the PCEs of the SHJ solar cells. A series of strategies are applied to optimize the Schottky barrier between p-a-Si:H and IWO. One approach is to apply MgF2 as a double-layer AR coating on top of the optimal device, the EQEintegrated Jsc was improved from 39.41 mA/cm2 to 40.16 mA/cm2 [128]. The ﬁnal 8.97-cm2 wide IWO/MgF2-based solar cell showed an active area cell efﬁciency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efﬁciency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b, Table 1) [128]. Additionally, the H diffusion from a-Si:H to tungsten-doped indium (IWOH) is reported to not only reduce the Rsheet of the TCO ﬁlms but also optimize the interfaces of a-Si:H/IWO [130]. The improved PCE of 22.3% for the IWOH-based solar cells was achieved on an average for 4cm2 SHJ cells, which have higher Jsc and PCEs than the IWO-based solar cell and similar FF [130]. Further, the prolonged hydrogen annealing process for the IWO-based solar cells gained the PCE by 1.14% to 23.31%, with a device area of 244.5 cm2 [129]. The aspect of electrical and optical properties, IWO is a desirable material for industrial SHJ solar cells, especially in solar cells with low-cost copper conductor grids [138]. A SHJ solar cell with copper as the metal grids and IWO as the transparent electrodes, which are fabricated in the lab and SIMIT's R&D line, reached a PCE of over 22%, showing great potential for the copper metallization of the SHJ solar cells with reduced cost and overcoming the limitations of screen-printing technology (Fig. 6c) [131]. By now, there is a consensus within the industrialization of IWO that the content of indium in the excellent performance of IWO (In:W ¼ 95:5) is still insufﬁciently ideal [128,129,137,133], where the high production costs would the pressing issue. In a word, IWO can provide advantages over ITO due to its lower absorption in the long wavelength region. However, there is still room for further improvement in conversion efﬁciency. Fig. 6.

Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 8 3.1.4. Alternative doped indium oxide To date, there are indium-based TCOs with other doping metals such as cerium, titanium, and zirconium, which mainly perform as front transparent electrodes for the solar cells having sensitivity in the visible to the NIR wavelength region [78,125,139e141]. The large potential of the optimally processed In2O3:Ce:H (ICO:H) window layers in SHJ cells is demonstrated, quantiﬁed by the improvement in Jsc of 0.6 mA/cm2 without impairing the resistive losses in comparison to the usage of baseline ITO layers [139]. By further incorporating ICO:H instead of conventional ITO and IO:H ﬁlms, an improved PCE of 24.1%, a Voc of 745 mV, a Jsc of 38.8 mA/ cm2, and a FF of 83.2% were obtained [78]. It is believed that their high carrier mobility of 140 cm2/(V$s) contributed to their high efﬁciency. Already, SHJ solar cells with the optimized indium zirconium oxide (IZrO) front electrodes resulted in a Jsc of 40 mA/cm2, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 23.4% [141]. A heterojunction solar cell with an ITO/IZrO bilayer electrode succeeds in a Jsc of 38.72 mA/ cm2, a FF of 82.39%, and a PCE of up to 23.59% [140]. Similarly, the signiﬁcant reduction of the reﬂection loss of the conventional and needle-like Hf-doped In2O3 (IHFO) bilayer ﬁlms deposited on the textured silicon was observed. The short-circuit current and efﬁciency of the solar cell were improved by 0.52 mA/cm2 and 0.39%, utilizing a needle-like IHFO thin ﬁlm as an AR layer [134]. As for the manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells increases or future tandem devices, there are signiﬁcant concerns about the use of indium. The values of indium consumption per cell and per generated power for SHJ solar cells from different sources exhibited large discrepancies, but all available data indicate concern about the insufﬁcient supply of indium to support in the future [25]. Signiﬁcantly, reducing indium consumption for TCO ﬁlms has become mandatory to push SHJ solar cell technology toward a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. As an alternative to minimizing the use of metallic indium, thin indiumbased TCOs (with better performance) or the IBC cell design might be a choice. With a reduced thickness of approximately 30 nm for ITO layers, the resource-sustainable manufacturing capacity of SHJ solar cells would be substantially increased to 115e330 GW. However, this would only account for approximately 5e10% of a 3 TW market size, suggesting that the SHJ solar cell using ITO in some form remains a niche product. Moreover, reducing the thickness of ITO layers could also lead to signiﬁcant increases in rc due to the changes in current pathways and the current crowding effect. For example, 20-nm-thick ITO capped by a non-indiumbased TCO would greatly increase the sustainable manufacturing capacity compared to the present implementation for SHJ solar cells relying solely on ITO [25]. Thus, substituting part or full of ITO with a more transparent and less expensive dielectric indium-free ﬁlm is promising. 3.2. Doped zinc oxide Typically, an approximately 70-nm-thick ITO layer is used on each surface to form thin transparent conductive layers at the front and rear of the SHJ solar cells, corresponding to approximately 5.7 mg/W consumption of ITO and 4.2 mg/W consumption of indium, with an assumed cell PCE of 25.11% [25]. Thus, the future of cSi PVs would beneﬁt greatly from any alternative indium-free layer to circumvent the parasitic absorption in TCOs. As for the choice of indium-free TCOs in SHJ, AZOs, with low cost, abundant material reserves in nature and capability of achieving comparable efﬁciencies to the ITO-based SHJ solar cells, has been considered as one of the few potential alternatives to ITOs [109,142]. To reduce the use of indium, both ITO 50%/AZO 50% and ITO 25%/ AZO 50%/ITO 25% were used on the back of SHJ solar cells with a decent performance, which was close to that of individual ITO (Fig. 7a) [114]. The performance of the SHJ solar cells with such two kinds of TCO stacks as the back TCO layers was greatly improved compared to that with the individual AZO layer [114]. Meanwhile, the PCE gap between such the ITO/AZO stacks and the individual ITO stack could be narrowed to approximately 0.1% (absolute value), showing the possibility of applying the ITO/AZO stack structure in the SHJ solar cell [114]. Considering the use of indium-free TCOs, the AZO layers were used in three different cell conﬁgurations labeled as ‘front-AZO cell’, ‘back-AZO cell’. and ‘all-AZO cell’ [144]. At the early stage, it was found that the PCE was challenging to exceed 20% for the SHJ solar cells with the direct application of the individual AZO ﬁlm as a front-AZO cell (Table 2) [109,142]. For further improving the light coupling by textured AZO or the implementation of the electrochemically grown ZnO nanorod as AR layers on AZO, less discernible enhancement of the PCE was observed (Fig. 7b) [142]. Thanks to the optimization of experimental conditions for AZO, the abovementioned front AZO cell showed an overall increasing PCE of over 20% [143]. The low PCE was attributed to the poor contact of aSi:H(p)/AZO and the low electrical and optical properties of AZO. The optimized low-resistivity a-Si:H(p)/AZO contact by the implementation of a trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) doped a-Si:H(p) ﬁlm as a hole transport layer enables a FF above 81% and a PCE of 23.6% for the front-AZO SHJ solar cells, comparable with 23.7%-efﬁcient cells using traditional ITO (Fig. 7c) [143]. In addition, the back-AZO cell experienced a similar performance improvement path as that of the front-AZO cell. Featuring a standard screen-printed silver grid at the front with approximately 3.25% optical shadowing, a champion device of the black-AZO cell a Jsc of up to 40.81 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 23.96% was obtained [112]. As for all-AZO cells, a 4-cm2 cell was certiﬁed at ISFH CalTec with an efﬁciency of 23.0%, a VOC of 738.8 mV, a FF of 80.3%, and a JSC of 38.7 mA/cm2 [145].

W. Cui, F. Chen, Y. Li et al. Materials Today Nano 22 (2023) 100329 9 Furthermore, an all-AZO cell with a 244 cm2 total area reached a PCE as high as 21.3% by using an amorphous silicon oxide layer (aSiO2) as an AR coating. Thus far, AZO appeared to be a promising indium-free alternative material to replace the back ITO commonly used in SHJ solar cells. Remarkably, the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved problem [113,145]. Signiﬁcantly increasing electrical resistivity and surface degradation were obtained, when the AZO is exposed to a harsh environment (e.g. annealing in the air or humidity damping). Damp heat test results of encapsulated SHJ devices with AZO as the TCO ﬁlms exhibited relative FF degradation of 7% after 1000 h [145]. This drawback prevents AZO ﬁlms to be deployed in real applications that require long-term reliability of the devices. Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of effort still needs to be put into battle with the relatively poor conductivity and long-term stability of AZO layers. For example, the FF degradation rate might reduce with the deposition of a-SiO2 or SiNx under humid conditions [145]. However, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance. 3.3. Other TCOs Alternatively, silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and graphene have also attracted attention [146e151]. Ag NWselectrodes can be deposited on top of the SHJ structure by mechanical transfer or solution technologies while achieving excellent transmittance and conductivity. However, Ag was reported to maintain low contact resistance between the silicon layer and metal, but it could easily react with a thin-ﬁlm silicon layer to form an insulating layer of AgO that blocks charge extraction. The issues remain to be tackled in the other metal-based TCOs, such as Ti, Cu, et al. [23] By inserting a SiNx layer to suppress the deterioration of the passivation quality of the Ti layer induced by direct metal-to-a-Si:H contacts, an indium-free design for SHJ solar cells achieve low series resistivity, a decent FF (80.7%), and efﬁciencies (>22%) [118]. Regarding graphene-based TCOs, until now, it is still arguable for use as a transparent electrode for any solar cell, since it would absorb signiﬁcantly over the full spectrum and shows large Rsheet [147]. 4. TCO ﬁlms for practical applications In mass production, rear-emitter (RE) structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n)/TCO/metal) are nowadays widely applied in the mass production of SHJ solar cells, taking the place of the traditional front emitter structures (metal/TCO/aSi:H(n)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n)/a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p)/TCO/metal) [7,14,152]. As discussed above , it is a trade-off between lateral conductivity and transparency in TCO ﬁlms. And in RE structures, by alternating the p/n junction with the high/low junction [32,152,153] at the front side, the lateral transport of the free carriers partially shifted from the TCO ﬁlms into the Si wafer, slightly decreasing the Rsheet. As a result, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties becomes less stringent at the front side [119,153]. Therefore, the requirements of the TCO ﬁlms for the front and the rear sides are different, depending on the structures of the SHJ solar cells. In RE structures, the requirement of the front side TCO ﬁlms is primarily on their optical properties rather than their electrical ones, which means low absorption and high carrier mobility but relatively low Fig. 7.

While the rear side needs better electron properties like relatively high carrier density and high carrier mobility. ITO materials have been widely applied as transparent electrodes, ever since the beginning of the SHJ solar cell development. It has been proven that the ratio of In:Sn played an important role in manipulating the carrier density, mobility, and transmittance of the ITO ﬁlms [59]. In SHJ solar cell mass production, 97/3-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 97/3) are chosen as the front TCO layers due to their excellent transparent capacity [154]. While 90/10-ITO ﬁlms (mass ratio of In2O3/SnO2 ¼ 90/10) are integrated on the rear sides because of their low resistance [154]. With the improvement of PCEs of the SHJ solar cells, the relatively low carrier mobility of the ITO materials of less than 40 cm/(V$s) is gradually becoming a limiting factor, especially on the front side. Therefore, to improve the PCE of the SHJ solar cells, TCO materials with excellent transparency and high carrier mobility are introduced into the cells. Dong et al. [14]. selected a multidoped indium-based material IMO:H to enhance the charge mobility of the front TCO ﬁlms, and a certiﬁed PCE of 25.26% is accomplished. The IMO:H layers exhibited high carrier mobility of over 70 cm/(V$s) at a Ne of around 2 1020 cm3 and improved transmittance within below the 400-nm-wavelength range. Additionally, the IMO: H ﬁlms were also proven to possess lower rc with mc-Si:H(n). Besides the PCEs, the total cost of SHJ solar cell is also a critical obstacle to industrialization. Beneﬁting the uniquely indispensable TCO layers in SHJ, a low-temperatureesintering metal paste could be used, providing the possibility to reduce the cost by using scarce materials. Silver in the grid electrodes is going to be reduced or replaced by a base metal, such as Cu@Ag core-shell materials [155] or Cu with surface oxidation resistance [156]. Until 2021, the costs of TCO targets are still an important factor, which spend more than 10% of the consumable costs [7]. The main reason is the relatively high price of indium [26]. Hence, indium-free TCO materials, such as AZO [112,145], are also attempted to integrate into the SHJ solar cells. Compared with ITO, stability veriﬁed by industry and academia, it is still an open question whether a TCO-free design could potentially give optimal device performance since the environmental stability of AZO ﬁlms is still an unsolved issue. AZO ﬁlms still face challenges of relatively high resistivity [157,158]. Another possible approach would be using multilayered AR coatings such as SiOx [24], SiNx [118,119], and MgF2 [117] on top of extremely thin ITO layers. In this way, the usage of indium could be reduced while still maintaining low resistivity contact. For example, SHJ solar cells have the potential to achieve an excellent Jsc beyond 42 mA/cm2 if the front-side ITO layer can be replaced by an ITO/SiNx double layer [118,119]. 5. Summary and perspective Herein, we presented a comprehensive review covering all the aspects of TCO ﬁlms in the application of SHJ solar cells, from basic functions to materials, as well as their application in mass production. SHJ solar cells are a fundamental approach for accomplishing high-efﬁciency PV devices. In SHJ solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms act as literal conductive layers which connect the doped a-/mc-Si:H layers and the metal grids. As a fundamental role in the solar cells, the TCO ﬁlms have a key impact on PCEs and the production cost of the solar cell intensively. ITO materials are still the most widely applied TCOs in SHJ solar cells in mass production. But their relatively low carrier mobility of less than 40 cm/(Vs) is becoming a limiting factor to meet the continuous demand for elevating solar cell performance. Meanwhile, the high indium consumption of ITO ﬁlms hinders further reducing the production cost. Therefore, TCO materials, deposition techniques as well as PVD equipment should be further investigated for SHJ solar cells to enhance the performance and mitigate the cost. Here, we outline possible research approaches and challenges that have to be addressed for the future development of TCO ﬁlms. Development of high-mobility TCOs. In TCO ﬁlms, it is a tradeoff between the conductivity and the transparency via tuning Ne. While with the improvement of m, the conductivity of TCO ﬁlms could be enhanced without any losses in transmittance. Hence, the development of high-mobility (>100 cm2/(Vs)) TCO materials is highly required for the mass production of SHJ solar cells. Application of multilayered TCO structures. To deduct the rc of the TCO/doped a-Si:H and the TCO/Ag grid interfaces, the materials composite from the front to the rear side of TCO ﬁlms should be different. Consequently, multilayer structures, in which materials with different WFs or Ne, should be applied in TCO ﬁlms. Low-damage TCO coating methods. The PVD coating methods and processes to fabricate TCO ﬁlms play a signiﬁcant role on the passivation effect of the substrates. Therefore, the development of low-damage TCO coating equipment or processes that are suitable for mass production is indispensable for improving cell efﬁciency. Reduction of indium consumption. The high indium consumption of TCO ﬁlms is one of the detrimental factors that hinders the cost reduction of SHJ solar cells. To deduct the indium consumption or develop indium-free TCO ﬁlms, it is highly required to apply in SHJ solar cells. Meanwhile, the technique of deposition of an ARC on top of the TCO ﬁlms, which means shrinking the thickness of TCO ﬁlms, also should be applied in solar cells. Silicon solar cells can be manufactured, even at the TW scale, where the photoactive bulk silicon layer avoids any scarce materials, and the silver grid electrode is going to be substituted by base metals, such as copper. SHJ solar cells are going to be the predominant production in the market of Si-based PV devices in the future. As the key cost issues for the SHJ devices, the development of TCO ﬁlms still faces some challenges. We believe this review would prompt us to learn the achievements, remaining challenges, as well as possible investigation directions, and promote the development of TCO ﬁlms in SHJ solar cells rapidly.

DOI: 10.1063/1.3116542 I. INTRODUCTION Doped In2O3 IOﬁlms represent some of the highestquality transparent conducting oxides TCOspresently available. Reasons include its ability to maintain high mobility at high carrier concentration and low optical absorption. IO ﬁlms can be doped using several group IVA and IVB dopants, including Ti, Zr IZrO, and Sn In2O3:SnO2 ITO.1 However, most reports suggest that the optimal balance between electrical and optical quality is produced with Sn doping.2 High-quality ITO ﬁlms can be produced by magnetron sputtering using substrate temperatures of 250° –350 °C and an ambient in which the oxygen partial pressure is controlled to yield a slight oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm. However, when the sputter ambient becomes too oxygen deﬁcient, the optical transparency of the ﬁlm decreases. The challenge during ITO deposition is to incorporate enough oxygen to produce ﬁlms with high transparency and optimal electrical properties. In production coating systems, this critical balance of oxygen must be maintained over a large deposition area, and it is often adjusted for variations in target use, seasonal changes, and maintenance activities. Our recent investigations have identiﬁed a method to produce ﬁlms that are similar to ITO but are less sensitive to variations in the oxygen-containing deposition ambient. We have used IO and ITO ceramic sputtering targets that contain a small amount of Zr to produce sputtered ﬁlms on barium borosilicate glass substrates. Electrical and optical analyses of these ﬁlms reveal that an 0.5 at. % addition of Zr to ITO referred to as ITZOallows fabrication of lowresistance ﬁlms at higher oxygen partial pressure and fabrication of higher optical-transmission ﬁlms at lower oxygen partial pressure. The improved optical transmission is especially obvious in the near-infrared NIRspectral region. We believe these beneﬁts may embody advantages for large-area ITO ﬁlm production and could point the way toward similar beneﬁts in other TCOs such as those based on ZnO, SnO2, CdO, and mixed alloys. II. EXPERIMENTAL Films were prepared using radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at 13.56 MHz in a sputter-down conﬁguration from 2 in. planar targets of 99.99% purity. The sourcesubstrate separation was 1.27 cm. Doped targets were fabricated by CERAC, Inc. Milwaukee, WIand were produced by hot pressing followed by ﬁring in oxygen at 760 °C. The undoped IO target was produced by Pure Tech Brewster, NYand was 99.99% pure. The four target compositions compared in this study are shown in Table I. Film deposition was performed in a Uniﬁlm Technologies sputtering system that is capable of automated control of both substrate orbit and rotary motion to enhance deposit uniformity. Base pressures of 510−8–210−7 torr were established using a cryopump maximum speciﬁed throughput =8.9 torr l s−1, Arprior to each deposition. Ultra-highpurity argon 99.999%and oxygen 99.995%were used as the sputtering gases. Gas ﬂows and partial pressure ratio were set using needle valves prior to throttling to the sputtering pressure of 10 mtorr, which was measured with a aElectronic mail: tim_gessert@nrel.gov. TABLE I.

The ratio of oxygen to argon pressure in the sputter ambient is described as O2% using the following relation: O2% = PO2/PAr+ PO2100, 1 where PO2and PArare the oxygen and argon pressures measured with an ion gauge before throttling. Note, because the ionization efﬁciency of Ar is higher than O2, the absolute O2% in the ambient will be higher than the relative O2% indicated by Eq. 1. Sputtering was conducted at constant power of 80 W, and ﬁlms were produced with thicknesses from 100 to 1200 nm. Corning 7059 glass substrates were cleaned using a 5% solution of 18 Mde-ionized water and Citranox in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, followed by rinsing in de-ionized water, spin rinsing to an output water resistivity of 12 M and spin drying. Substrates were placed on a rotatable heater boron-nitride elementoperating at a constant voltage. Depositions were performed at substrate temperatures of 120° –420 °C. The substrate temperature was calibrated in vacuum by placing a 0.32-cm-thick Al block with an embedded thermocouple at the substrate position and allowing the block to equilibrate for 2 h. Following deposition, the samples were maintained in the sputtering ambient and temperature for 1 h, after which the gases and the heater were shut off and the substrate was allowed to cool under vacuum for 1 h. This postdeposition procedure was found to be necessary to achieve reproducibility of ﬁlm electrical parameters. The thickness of the 200–1200 nm ﬁlms was measured using stylus proﬁlometry Veeco Dektak 3, and the 100–200 nm ﬁlms were measured using ellipsometry Rudolph Research Type 43702–200E. Optical measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer Varian Cary 5G in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. The ﬁlm resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration were obtained at room temperature from Hall analysis using the van der Pauw method BioRad HL5500 System. Spectroscopic ellipsometry SEmeasurements were performed to analyze dielectric constants using a J.A. Woollam M-2000 rotating compensator ellipsometer at three angles of incidence 55°, 60°, and 65°in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The data were analyzed using a three-layer optical model consisting of surface roughness, a graded TCO ﬁlm, and a glass substrate. The TCO ﬁlm was represented by a Drude oscillator to model free-carrier absorption at long wavelengths and by a pole to model dispersion due to absorption at higher energies outside the spectral range. The oscillator parameters were allowed to vary independently at the top and bottom of the TCO ﬁlm and were connected by a multinode linear grading. Surface roughness was modeled as a Bruggeman effective medium approximation of a 50% mixture of voids and TCO material. Layer thicknesses, grading, and optical constant parameters were ﬁt simultaneously over multiple angles and wavelengths for each sample. III. RESULTS A. Electrical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms The material properties of nearly all TCO ﬁlms are known to demonstrate signiﬁcant dependence on substrate temperature and O2%. Previous studies with IO-based materials indicated that optimum material properties are produced at substrate temperatures between 200 and 400 °C.3,4 At these deposition temperatures, O2% is typically optimized at 0.3%.5 Table II shows that results from this work are consistent with these previous studies. The table also provides an indication of material properties for ﬁlms deposited in a relatively “low” versus “high” O2% ambient. Here low and high O2% represents the approximate end points of the optimum range of O2% for each ﬁlm type. For these studies, high O2% leads to higher mobility and lower carrier concentration, whereas low O2% ambient produces lower mobility and higher carrier concentration. Because of the importance of high mobility and low carrier concentration to reduce freecarrier absorption, TCO ﬁlms are often optimized in the high O2% range. For this study, the more important beneﬁt of controlling ﬁlm electrical properties through O2% is that one can produce pairs of ITO and ITZO ﬁlms that demonstrate nearly identical electrical properties. This allows the effect of Zr on optical properties to be assessed separately from the effect that mobility and carrier concentration have on optical properties i.e., Drude theory expectations.6 Table II shows that minimum resistivity in IO ﬁlms results from deposition conditions that produce a carrier concentration in the range of 1019 cm−3 and mobility in the range of 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The reason for low carrier concentration is likely because donors related either directly or indirectly to oxygen vacancies are not as effective as the group IV substitutional donors i.e., Sn or Zr. The mobility for IO is consistent with other reports, as well as with other undoped TCO thin ﬁlms.7 In contrast, ITO ﬁlms produced during this study had carrier concentrations of 7–15 1020 cm−3, and the highest-mobility ITO ﬁlm demonstrated carrier concentration and mobility of 4.4 1020 cm−3 and 42.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. IZrO ﬁlms demonstrated reasonable direct current electrical properties although poorer than the ITO ﬁlms. Typical TABLE II. Representative deposition parameters and resulting electrical properties for IO-based ﬁlms fabricated during this study. For each ﬁlm type, electrical properties are indicated for both a high and low O2% ambient condition.

J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 carrier concentrations were 0.2–41020 cm3 with mobilities of 7–15 cm2 V−1 s−1. A higher carrier concentration could be expected for the IZrO ﬁlms compared to the ITO ﬁlms because the atomic percent of Zr is higher in the IZrO target than Sn in the ITO target 3.93 at. % versus 3.29 at. %, respectively; see Table I. However, the fact that IZrO ﬁlms demonstrate higher carrier concentration than the IO ﬁlms indicates that Zr is an effective donor in IO-based TCOs. The observation that IZrO did not achieve mobility greater than 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 differs from historic reports in which mobilities approaching 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 are suggested.1 The lower mobility achieved in this study may result from differences in deposition processes and/or analysis. However, another possibility is that the concentration of ZrO2 9 wt % in our targetis excessive and reducing Zr content may lead to increased mobility in IZrO ﬁlms. Another important difference between ITO and IZrO ﬁlms is that the electrical properties of IZrO ﬁlms were found to be much less sensitive to variations in O2%.8 This observation will be discussed more fully below. Electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms were found to be nominally identical to ITO ﬁlms once the effect of O2% ambient is considered. This is consistent with the observation that Zr is an effective dopant in IO and suggests that a small amount of ZrO2 1 wt % ZrO2does not perturb signiﬁcantly the carrier-scattering processes in the predominantly ITO matrix. Similar to ITO, fabrication of ITZO ﬁlms with high electrical quality required a small addition of oxygen to the sputtering ambient 0.5%. Also, similar to the IZrO ﬁlms, and as suggested in Table II, we found that the electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms can be optimized over a wider range of O2% than ITO ﬁlms. Figure 1 shows that the ITZO ﬁlm maintains a resistivity of 310−4 cm to O2% of 0.7%, whereas the ITO ﬁlm exceeds this resistivity for O2%0.5%. This functionality could provide advantages to large-area production of ITO-like ﬁlms, especially when one considers that variation in O2% can arise from many sources, including wall and sample outgassing, leakage, and seasonal humidity variations.8 As will be shown below, this advantage is leveraged when the optical beneﬁts of Zr addition to ITO are considered. B. Optical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms Figure 2 compares the optical transparency of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms deposited in pure Ar. These ﬁlms were produced to be thicker 0.7–1.2 mthan is typical for many applications to enhance differences in optical transmission. The poor transmission demonstrated by most of the ﬁlms 5%is consistent for TCO ﬁlms sputtered at high temperature in an Ar-only ambient with low base pressure of other impurities base pressure for this study is 5 10−8 torr. In contrast, Fig. 2 shows that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar demonstrates very high transparency 80%. This is true even though this target had been used for numerous prior depositions; therefore, it is unlikely that the higher transmission is due to high but metastableoxygen concentration near the target surface. This difference in transmission suggests that the Zr either facilitates oxygen incorporation into the depositing ﬁlms or changes the material properties such that less oxygen is required to achieve high transparency. Figure 3 compares a thinner IZrO ﬁlm 0.1 mproduced in pure Ar with two ITO ﬁlms produced in optimal O2%. One of the ITO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 3 was produced using the same target used to produce the ITO target shown in Fig. 2, and the other was produced by a commercial vendor.

Figure compares spectral transmission of an IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar, an ITO ﬁlm of similar thickness produced in an optimal Ar/O2 ambient, and an ITO ﬁlm produced by a commercial vendor. Reﬂection is shown for ITO ﬁlms but is not available for the IZrO ﬁlm. Comparison illustrates that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar is of good optical quality even when compared to high-quality ITO ﬁlms. 083547-3 Gessert et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 both of the other “optimal” ITO ﬁlms, suggesting that IZrO may have applications in which ﬁlms grown without oxygen are preferred. Based on the indications that Zr is both a reasonable n-type dopant for IO and that IZrO can maintain high ﬁlm transparency at low O2%, ITZO ﬁlms were produced to determine if the optical beneﬁts observed for IZrO could be engineered into a ﬁlm with an electrical quality more consistent with ITO. Figure 4 shows an ITZO and ITO ﬁlm that was produced using high O2% in the sputtering ambient, while Fig. 5 shows a similar pair of ﬁlms produced in a low O2% ambient. Note that these ﬁgures compare ﬁlms that are both of similar thickness and electrical properties i.e., carrier concentrations and mobility, measured using roomtemperature Hall measurements. By selecting ITO and ITZO ﬁlms with this high degree of similarity, differences due to free-carrier absorption can be minimized.6 The comparisons show that the ITZO ﬁlms demonstrate higher transmission than the ITO ﬁlm in both the visible 500–700 nmand NIR spectral region. It is also noted that the difference in NIR transmission of the ITZO ﬁlm is even greater for the ﬁlms with lower carrier concentration shown in Fig. 4. Our suggested reasons for these observations are discussed below. C. SE Drude theory is usually adequate to explain the optical and electrical properties of TCOs. However, the difference in optical transmission shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for ﬁlms with similar carrier concentration and mobility suggests that the details of free-electron absorption as suggested by Drude theory require closer inspection. Figure 6 shows SE analysis indicating the spectral variation for the real part of the dielectric coefﬁcient 1in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The ITO and ITZO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 6 are the same ﬁlms shown in Fig. 4 and have very similar carrier concentration. The SE data were ﬁtted using a linear graded-layer model with ﬁve steps between nodes two or three nodes incorporated, in which the end points were ﬁxed and the complex dielectric coefﬁcient within the central region was allowed to vary. The data shown in Fig. 6 represent 1 at the bottom of the respective ﬁlm stacks i.e., the location near the TCO/glass interface. The SE analysis shows that as Zr is added to the IO host material, 1 increases within the wavelength range probed. This overall increase in 1 with Zr content in this spectral range remains true, regardless of the ﬁlm depth at which 1 is analyzed. IV. DISCUSSION The results above indicate that addition of Zr to IObased TCOs can provide the following beneﬁts compared to ITO: 1for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zrcontaining ﬁlms maintain higher carrier concentration at higher O2%; 2for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zr-containing ﬁlms maintain higher transparency at reduced O2%; and 3Zr-containing ﬁlms demonstrate higher visible and infrared transparency at optimum O2%. The combination of the ﬁrst two beneﬁts presents a compelling pathway toward the production of ITO-like ﬁlms with a wider window for process optimization and reproducibility. The third observation suggests that the addition of Zr has produced a fundamental alteration to the ITO material and that it may be possible to exploit this alteration to improve the performance of TCOs, in general. 80 60 40 20 0 T, R, A (%) 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 Wavelength (nm) ITZO_005 (0.448 μm, 7.92x10 20 cm -3, 35.0 cm 2 V -1sec -1) ITO_004 (0.451 μm, 7.29x10 20 cm -3, 36.9 cm 2 V -1sec -1) R T A FIG. 4.

DOI: 10.1063/1.3116542 I. INTRODUCTION Doped In2O3 IOﬁlms represent some of the highestquality transparent conducting oxides TCOspresently available. Reasons include its ability to maintain high mobility at high carrier concentration and low optical absorption. IO ﬁlms can be doped using several group IVA and IVB dopants, including Ti, Zr IZrO, and Sn In2O3:SnO2 ITO.1 However, most reports suggest that the optimal balance between electrical and optical quality is produced with Sn doping.2 High-quality ITO ﬁlms can be produced by magnetron sputtering using substrate temperatures of 250° –350 °C and an ambient in which the oxygen partial pressure is controlled to yield a slight oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm. However, when the sputter ambient becomes too oxygen deﬁcient, the optical transparency of the ﬁlm decreases. The challenge during ITO deposition is to incorporate enough oxygen to produce ﬁlms with high transparency and optimal electrical properties. In production coating systems, this critical balance of oxygen must be maintained over a large deposition area, and it is often adjusted for variations in target use, seasonal changes, and maintenance activities. Our recent investigations have identiﬁed a method to produce ﬁlms that are similar to ITO but are less sensitive to variations in the oxygen-containing deposition ambient. We have used IO and ITO ceramic sputtering targets that contain a small amount of Zr to produce sputtered ﬁlms on barium borosilicate glass substrates. Electrical and optical analyses of these ﬁlms reveal that an 0.5 at. % addition of Zr to ITO referred to as ITZOallows fabrication of lowresistance ﬁlms at higher oxygen partial pressure and fabrication of higher optical-transmission ﬁlms at lower oxygen partial pressure. The improved optical transmission is especially obvious in the near-infrared NIRspectral region. We believe these beneﬁts may embody advantages for large-area ITO ﬁlm production and could point the way toward similar beneﬁts in other TCOs such as those based on ZnO, SnO2, CdO, and mixed alloys. II. EXPERIMENTAL Films were prepared using radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at 13.56 MHz in a sputter-down conﬁguration from 2 in. planar targets of 99.99% purity. The sourcesubstrate separation was 1.27 cm. Doped targets were fabricated by CERAC, Inc. Milwaukee, WIand were produced by hot pressing followed by ﬁring in oxygen at 760 °C. The undoped IO target was produced by Pure Tech Brewster, NYand was 99.99% pure. The four target compositions compared in this study are shown in Table I. Film deposition was performed in a Uniﬁlm Technologies sputtering system that is capable of automated control of both substrate orbit and rotary motion to enhance deposit uniformity. Base pressures of 510−8–210−7 torr were established using a cryopump maximum speciﬁed throughput =8.9 torr l s−1, Arprior to each deposition. Ultra-highpurity argon 99.999%and oxygen 99.995%were used as the sputtering gases. Gas ﬂows and partial pressure ratio were set using needle valves prior to throttling to the sputtering pressure of 10 mtorr, which was measured with a aElectronic mail: tim_gessert@nrel.gov. TABLE I.

The ratio of oxygen to argon pressure in the sputter ambient is described as O2% using the following relation: O2% = PO2/PAr+ PO2100, 1 where PO2and PArare the oxygen and argon pressures measured with an ion gauge before throttling. Note, because the ionization efﬁciency of Ar is higher than O2, the absolute O2% in the ambient will be higher than the relative O2% indicated by Eq. 1. Sputtering was conducted at constant power of 80 W, and ﬁlms were produced with thicknesses from 100 to 1200 nm. Corning 7059 glass substrates were cleaned using a 5% solution of 18 Mde-ionized water and Citranox in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, followed by rinsing in de-ionized water, spin rinsing to an output water resistivity of 12 M and spin drying. Substrates were placed on a rotatable heater boron-nitride elementoperating at a constant voltage. Depositions were performed at substrate temperatures of 120° –420 °C. The substrate temperature was calibrated in vacuum by placing a 0.32-cm-thick Al block with an embedded thermocouple at the substrate position and allowing the block to equilibrate for 2 h. Following deposition, the samples were maintained in the sputtering ambient and temperature for 1 h, after which the gases and the heater were shut off and the substrate was allowed to cool under vacuum for 1 h. This postdeposition procedure was found to be necessary to achieve reproducibility of ﬁlm electrical parameters. The thickness of the 200–1200 nm ﬁlms was measured using stylus proﬁlometry Veeco Dektak 3, and the 100–200 nm ﬁlms were measured using ellipsometry Rudolph Research Type 43702–200E. Optical measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer Varian Cary 5G in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. The ﬁlm resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration were obtained at room temperature from Hall analysis using the van der Pauw method BioRad HL5500 System. Spectroscopic ellipsometry SEmeasurements were performed to analyze dielectric constants using a J.A. Woollam M-2000 rotating compensator ellipsometer at three angles of incidence 55°, 60°, and 65°in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The data were analyzed using a three-layer optical model consisting of surface roughness, a graded TCO ﬁlm, and a glass substrate. The TCO ﬁlm was represented by a Drude oscillator to model free-carrier absorption at long wavelengths and by a pole to model dispersion due to absorption at higher energies outside the spectral range. The oscillator parameters were allowed to vary independently at the top and bottom of the TCO ﬁlm and were connected by a multinode linear grading. Surface roughness was modeled as a Bruggeman effective medium approximation of a 50% mixture of voids and TCO material. Layer thicknesses, grading, and optical constant parameters were ﬁt simultaneously over multiple angles and wavelengths for each sample. III. RESULTS A. Electrical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms The material properties of nearly all TCO ﬁlms are known to demonstrate signiﬁcant dependence on substrate temperature and O2%. Previous studies with IO-based materials indicated that optimum material properties are produced at substrate temperatures between 200 and 400 °C.3,4 At these deposition temperatures, O2% is typically optimized at 0.3%.5 Table II shows that results from this work are consistent with these previous studies. The table also provides an indication of material properties for ﬁlms deposited in a relatively “low” versus “high” O2% ambient. Here low and high O2% represents the approximate end points of the optimum range of O2% for each ﬁlm type. For these studies, high O2% leads to higher mobility and lower carrier concentration, whereas low O2% ambient produces lower mobility and higher carrier concentration. Because of the importance of high mobility and low carrier concentration to reduce freecarrier absorption, TCO ﬁlms are often optimized in the high O2% range. For this study, the more important beneﬁt of controlling ﬁlm electrical properties through O2% is that one can produce pairs of ITO and ITZO ﬁlms that demonstrate nearly identical electrical properties. This allows the effect of Zr on optical properties to be assessed separately from the effect that mobility and carrier concentration have on optical properties i.e., Drude theory expectations.6 Table II shows that minimum resistivity in IO ﬁlms results from deposition conditions that produce a carrier concentration in the range of 1019 cm−3 and mobility in the range of 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The reason for low carrier concentration is likely because donors related either directly or indirectly to oxygen vacancies are not as effective as the group IV substitutional donors i.e., Sn or Zr. The mobility for IO is consistent with other reports, as well as with other undoped TCO thin ﬁlms.7 In contrast, ITO ﬁlms produced during this study had carrier concentrations of 7–15 1020 cm−3, and the highest-mobility ITO ﬁlm demonstrated carrier concentration and mobility of 4.4 1020 cm−3 and 42.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. IZrO ﬁlms demonstrated reasonable direct current electrical properties although poorer than the ITO ﬁlms. Typical TABLE II. Representative deposition parameters and resulting electrical properties for IO-based ﬁlms fabricated during this study. For each ﬁlm type, electrical properties are indicated for both a high and low O2% ambient condition.

J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 carrier concentrations were 0.2–41020 cm3 with mobilities of 7–15 cm2 V−1 s−1. A higher carrier concentration could be expected for the IZrO ﬁlms compared to the ITO ﬁlms because the atomic percent of Zr is higher in the IZrO target than Sn in the ITO target 3.93 at. % versus 3.29 at. %, respectively; see Table I. However, the fact that IZrO ﬁlms demonstrate higher carrier concentration than the IO ﬁlms indicates that Zr is an effective donor in IO-based TCOs. The observation that IZrO did not achieve mobility greater than 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 differs from historic reports in which mobilities approaching 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 are suggested.1 The lower mobility achieved in this study may result from differences in deposition processes and/or analysis. However, another possibility is that the concentration of ZrO2 9 wt % in our targetis excessive and reducing Zr content may lead to increased mobility in IZrO ﬁlms. Another important difference between ITO and IZrO ﬁlms is that the electrical properties of IZrO ﬁlms were found to be much less sensitive to variations in O2%.8 This observation will be discussed more fully below. Electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms were found to be nominally identical to ITO ﬁlms once the effect of O2% ambient is considered. This is consistent with the observation that Zr is an effective dopant in IO and suggests that a small amount of ZrO2 1 wt % ZrO2does not perturb signiﬁcantly the carrier-scattering processes in the predominantly ITO matrix. Similar to ITO, fabrication of ITZO ﬁlms with high electrical quality required a small addition of oxygen to the sputtering ambient 0.5%. Also, similar to the IZrO ﬁlms, and as suggested in Table II, we found that the electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms can be optimized over a wider range of O2% than ITO ﬁlms. Figure 1 shows that the ITZO ﬁlm maintains a resistivity of 310−4 cm to O2% of 0.7%, whereas the ITO ﬁlm exceeds this resistivity for O2%0.5%. This functionality could provide advantages to large-area production of ITO-like ﬁlms, especially when one considers that variation in O2% can arise from many sources, including wall and sample outgassing, leakage, and seasonal humidity variations.8 As will be shown below, this advantage is leveraged when the optical beneﬁts of Zr addition to ITO are considered. B. Optical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms Figure 2 compares the optical transparency of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms deposited in pure Ar. These ﬁlms were produced to be thicker 0.7–1.2 mthan is typical for many applications to enhance differences in optical transmission. The poor transmission demonstrated by most of the ﬁlms 5%is consistent for TCO ﬁlms sputtered at high temperature in an Ar-only ambient with low base pressure of other impurities base pressure for this study is 5 10−8 torr. In contrast, Fig. 2 shows that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar demonstrates very high transparency 80%. This is true even though this target had been used for numerous prior depositions; therefore, it is unlikely that the higher transmission is due to high but metastableoxygen concentration near the target surface. This difference in transmission suggests that the Zr either facilitates oxygen incorporation into the depositing ﬁlms or changes the material properties such that less oxygen is required to achieve high transparency. Figure 3 compares a thinner IZrO ﬁlm 0.1 mproduced in pure Ar with two ITO ﬁlms produced in optimal O2%. One of the ITO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 3 was produced using the same target used to produce the ITO target shown in Fig. 2, and the other was produced by a commercial vendor.

Reﬂection is shown for ITO ﬁlms but is not available for the IZrO ﬁlm. Comparison illustrates that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar is of good optical quality even when compared to high-quality ITO ﬁlms. 083547-3 Gessert et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 both of the other “optimal” ITO ﬁlms, suggesting that IZrO may have applications in which ﬁlms grown without oxygen are preferred. Based on the indications that Zr is both a reasonable n-type dopant for IO and that IZrO can maintain high ﬁlm transparency at low O2%, ITZO ﬁlms were produced to determine if the optical beneﬁts observed for IZrO could be engineered into a ﬁlm with an electrical quality more consistent with ITO. Figure 4 shows an ITZO and ITO ﬁlm that was produced using high O2% in the sputtering ambient, while Fig. 5 shows a similar pair of ﬁlms produced in a low O2% ambient. Note that these ﬁgures compare ﬁlms that are both of similar thickness and electrical properties i.e., carrier concentrations and mobility, measured using roomtemperature Hall measurements. By selecting ITO and ITZO ﬁlms with this high degree of similarity, differences due to free-carrier absorption can be minimized.6 The comparisons show that the ITZO ﬁlms demonstrate higher transmission than the ITO ﬁlm in both the visible 500–700 nmand NIR spectral region. It is also noted that the difference in NIR transmission of the ITZO ﬁlm is even greater for the ﬁlms with lower carrier concentration shown in Fig. 4. Our suggested reasons for these observations are discussed below. C. SE Drude theory is usually adequate to explain the optical and electrical properties of TCOs. However, the difference in optical transmission shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for ﬁlms with similar carrier concentration and mobility suggests that the details of free-electron absorption as suggested by Drude theory require closer inspection. Figure 6 shows SE analysis indicating the spectral variation for the real part of the dielectric coefﬁcient 1in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The ITO and ITZO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 6 are the same ﬁlms shown in Fig. 4 and have very similar carrier concentration. The SE data were ﬁtted using a linear graded-layer model with ﬁve steps between nodes two or three nodes incorporated, in which the end points were ﬁxed and the complex dielectric coefﬁcient within the central region was allowed to vary. The data shown in Fig. 6 represent 1 at the bottom of the respective ﬁlm stacks i.e., the location near the TCO/glass interface. The SE analysis shows that as Zr is added to the IO host material, 1 increases within the wavelength range probed. This overall increase in 1 with Zr content in this spectral range remains true, regardless of the ﬁlm depth at which 1 is analyzed. IV. DISCUSSION The results above indicate that addition of Zr to IObased TCOs can provide the following beneﬁts compared to ITO: 1for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zrcontaining ﬁlms maintain higher carrier concentration at higher O2%; 2for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zr-containing ﬁlms maintain higher transparency at reduced O2%; and 3Zr-containing ﬁlms demonstrate higher visible and infrared transparency at optimum O2%. The combination of the ﬁrst two beneﬁts presents a compelling pathway toward the production of ITO-like ﬁlms with a wider window for process optimization and reproducibility. The third observation suggests that the addition of Zr has produced a fundamental alteration to the ITO material and that it may be possible to exploit this alteration to improve the performance of TCOs, in general. 80 60 40 20 0 T, R, A (%) 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 Wavelength (nm) ITZO_005 (0.448 μm, 7.92x10 20 cm -3, 35.0 cm 2 V -1sec -1) ITO_004 (0.451 μm, 7.29x10 20 cm -3, 36.9 cm 2 V -1sec -1) R T A FIG. 4.

DOI: 10.1063/1.3116542 I. INTRODUCTION Doped In2O3 IOﬁlms represent some of the highestquality transparent conducting oxides TCOspresently available. Reasons include its ability to maintain high mobility at high carrier concentration and low optical absorption. IO ﬁlms can be doped using several group IVA and IVB dopants, including Ti, Zr IZrO, and Sn In2O3:SnO2 ITO.1 However, most reports suggest that the optimal balance between electrical and optical quality is produced with Sn doping.2 High-quality ITO ﬁlms can be produced by magnetron sputtering using substrate temperatures of 250° –350 °C and an ambient in which the oxygen partial pressure is controlled to yield a slight oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm. However, when the sputter ambient becomes too oxygen deﬁcient, the optical transparency of the ﬁlm decreases. The challenge during ITO deposition is to incorporate enough oxygen to produce ﬁlms with high transparency and optimal electrical properties. In production coating systems, this critical balance of oxygen must be maintained over a large deposition area, and it is often adjusted for variations in target use, seasonal changes, and maintenance activities. Our recent investigations have identiﬁed a method to produce ﬁlms that are similar to ITO but are less sensitive to variations in the oxygen-containing deposition ambient. We have used IO and ITO ceramic sputtering targets that contain a small amount of Zr to produce sputtered ﬁlms on barium borosilicate glass substrates. Electrical and optical analyses of these ﬁlms reveal that an 0.5 at. % addition of Zr to ITO referred to as ITZOallows fabrication of lowresistance ﬁlms at higher oxygen partial pressure and fabrication of higher optical-transmission ﬁlms at lower oxygen partial pressure. The improved optical transmission is especially obvious in the near-infrared NIRspectral region. We believe these beneﬁts may embody advantages for large-area ITO ﬁlm production and could point the way toward similar beneﬁts in other TCOs such as those based on ZnO, SnO2, CdO, and mixed alloys. II. EXPERIMENTAL Films were prepared using radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at 13.56 MHz in a sputter-down conﬁguration from 2 in. planar targets of 99.99% purity. The sourcesubstrate separation was 1.27 cm. Doped targets were fabricated by CERAC, Inc. Milwaukee, WIand were produced by hot pressing followed by ﬁring in oxygen at 760 °C. The undoped IO target was produced by Pure Tech Brewster, NYand was 99.99% pure. The four target compositions compared in this study are shown in Table I. Film deposition was performed in a Uniﬁlm Technologies sputtering system that is capable of automated control of both substrate orbit and rotary motion to enhance deposit uniformity. Base pressures of 510−8–210−7 torr were established using a cryopump maximum speciﬁed throughput =8.9 torr l s−1, Arprior to each deposition. Ultra-highpurity argon 99.999%and oxygen 99.995%were used as the sputtering gases. Gas ﬂows and partial pressure ratio were set using needle valves prior to throttling to the sputtering pressure of 10 mtorr, which was measured with a aElectronic mail: tim_gessert@nrel.gov. TABLE I.

The ratio of oxygen to argon pressure in the sputter ambient is described as O2% using the following relation: O2% = PO2/PAr+ PO2100, 1 where PO2and PArare the oxygen and argon pressures measured with an ion gauge before throttling. Note, because the ionization efﬁciency of Ar is higher than O2, the absolute O2% in the ambient will be higher than the relative O2% indicated by Eq. 1. Sputtering was conducted at constant power of 80 W, and ﬁlms were produced with thicknesses from 100 to 1200 nm. Corning 7059 glass substrates were cleaned using a 5% solution of 18 Mde-ionized water and Citranox in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, followed by rinsing in de-ionized water, spin rinsing to an output water resistivity of 12 M and spin drying. Substrates were placed on a rotatable heater boron-nitride elementoperating at a constant voltage. Depositions were performed at substrate temperatures of 120° –420 °C. The substrate temperature was calibrated in vacuum by placing a 0.32-cm-thick Al block with an embedded thermocouple at the substrate position and allowing the block to equilibrate for 2 h. Following deposition, the samples were maintained in the sputtering ambient and temperature for 1 h, after which the gases and the heater were shut off and the substrate was allowed to cool under vacuum for 1 h. This postdeposition procedure was found to be necessary to achieve reproducibility of ﬁlm electrical parameters. The thickness of the 200–1200 nm ﬁlms was measured using stylus proﬁlometry Veeco Dektak 3, and the 100–200 nm ﬁlms were measured using ellipsometry Rudolph Research Type 43702–200E. Optical measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer Varian Cary 5G in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. The ﬁlm resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration were obtained at room temperature from Hall analysis using the van der Pauw method BioRad HL5500 System. Spectroscopic ellipsometry SEmeasurements were performed to analyze dielectric constants using a J.A. Woollam M-2000 rotating compensator ellipsometer at three angles of incidence 55°, 60°, and 65°in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The data were analyzed using a three-layer optical model consisting of surface roughness, a graded TCO ﬁlm, and a glass substrate. The TCO ﬁlm was represented by a Drude oscillator to model free-carrier absorption at long wavelengths and by a pole to model dispersion due to absorption at higher energies outside the spectral range. The oscillator parameters were allowed to vary independently at the top and bottom of the TCO ﬁlm and were connected by a multinode linear grading. Surface roughness was modeled as a Bruggeman effective medium approximation of a 50% mixture of voids and TCO material. Layer thicknesses, grading, and optical constant parameters were ﬁt simultaneously over multiple angles and wavelengths for each sample. III. RESULTS A. Electrical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms The material properties of nearly all TCO ﬁlms are known to demonstrate signiﬁcant dependence on substrate temperature and O2%. Previous studies with IO-based materials indicated that optimum material properties are produced at substrate temperatures between 200 and 400 °C.3,4 At these deposition temperatures, O2% is typically optimized at 0.3%.5 Table II shows that results from this work are consistent with these previous studies. The table also provides an indication of material properties for ﬁlms deposited in a relatively “low” versus “high” O2% ambient. Here low and high O2% represents the approximate end points of the optimum range of O2% for each ﬁlm type. For these studies, high O2% leads to higher mobility and lower carrier concentration, whereas low O2% ambient produces lower mobility and higher carrier concentration. Because of the importance of high mobility and low carrier concentration to reduce freecarrier absorption, TCO ﬁlms are often optimized in the high O2% range. For this study, the more important beneﬁt of controlling ﬁlm electrical properties through O2% is that one can produce pairs of ITO and ITZO ﬁlms that demonstrate nearly identical electrical properties. This allows the effect of Zr on optical properties to be assessed separately from the effect that mobility and carrier concentration have on optical properties i.e., Drude theory expectations.6 Table II shows that minimum resistivity in IO ﬁlms results from deposition conditions that produce a carrier concentration in the range of 1019 cm−3 and mobility in the range of 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The reason for low carrier concentration is likely because donors related either directly or indirectly to oxygen vacancies are not as effective as the group IV substitutional donors i.e., Sn or Zr. The mobility for IO is consistent with other reports, as well as with other undoped TCO thin ﬁlms.7 In contrast, ITO ﬁlms produced during this study had carrier concentrations of 7–15 1020 cm−3, and the highest-mobility ITO ﬁlm demonstrated carrier concentration and mobility of 4.4 1020 cm−3 and 42.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. IZrO ﬁlms demonstrated reasonable direct current electrical properties although poorer than the ITO ﬁlms. Typical TABLE II. Representative deposition parameters and resulting electrical properties for IO-based ﬁlms fabricated during this study. For each ﬁlm type, electrical properties are indicated for both a high and low O2% ambient condition.

J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 carrier concentrations were 0.2–41020 cm3 with mobilities of 7–15 cm2 V−1 s−1. A higher carrier concentration could be expected for the IZrO ﬁlms compared to the ITO ﬁlms because the atomic percent of Zr is higher in the IZrO target than Sn in the ITO target 3.93 at. % versus 3.29 at. %, respectively; see Table I. However, the fact that IZrO ﬁlms demonstrate higher carrier concentration than the IO ﬁlms indicates that Zr is an effective donor in IO-based TCOs. The observation that IZrO did not achieve mobility greater than 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 differs from historic reports in which mobilities approaching 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 are suggested.1 The lower mobility achieved in this study may result from differences in deposition processes and/or analysis. However, another possibility is that the concentration of ZrO2 9 wt % in our targetis excessive and reducing Zr content may lead to increased mobility in IZrO ﬁlms. Another important difference between ITO and IZrO ﬁlms is that the electrical properties of IZrO ﬁlms were found to be much less sensitive to variations in O2%.8 This observation will be discussed more fully below. Electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms were found to be nominally identical to ITO ﬁlms once the effect of O2% ambient is considered. This is consistent with the observation that Zr is an effective dopant in IO and suggests that a small amount of ZrO2 1 wt % ZrO2does not perturb signiﬁcantly the carrier-scattering processes in the predominantly ITO matrix. Similar to ITO, fabrication of ITZO ﬁlms with high electrical quality required a small addition of oxygen to the sputtering ambient 0.5%. Also, similar to the IZrO ﬁlms, and as suggested in Table II, we found that the electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms can be optimized over a wider range of O2% than ITO ﬁlms. Figure 1 shows that the ITZO ﬁlm maintains a resistivity of 310−4 cm to O2% of 0.7%, whereas the ITO ﬁlm exceeds this resistivity for O2%0.5%. This functionality could provide advantages to large-area production of ITO-like ﬁlms, especially when one considers that variation in O2% can arise from many sources, including wall and sample outgassing, leakage, and seasonal humidity variations.8 As will be shown below, this advantage is leveraged when the optical beneﬁts of Zr addition to ITO are considered. B. Optical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms Figure 2 compares the optical transparency of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms deposited in pure Ar. These ﬁlms were produced to be thicker 0.7–1.2 mthan is typical for many applications to enhance differences in optical transmission. The poor transmission demonstrated by most of the ﬁlms 5%is consistent for TCO ﬁlms sputtered at high temperature in an Ar-only ambient with low base pressure of other impurities base pressure for this study is 5 10−8 torr. In contrast, Fig. 2 shows that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar demonstrates very high transparency 80%. This is true even though this target had been used for numerous prior depositions; therefore, it is unlikely that the higher transmission is due to high but metastableoxygen concentration near the target surface. This difference in transmission suggests that the Zr either facilitates oxygen incorporation into the depositing ﬁlms or changes the material properties such that less oxygen is required to achieve high transparency. Figure 3 compares a thinner IZrO ﬁlm 0.1 mproduced in pure Ar with two ITO ﬁlms produced in optimal O2%. One of the ITO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 3 was produced using the same target used to produce the ITO target shown in Fig. 2, and the other was produced by a commercial vendor.

Figure compares spectral transmission of an IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar, an ITO ﬁlm of similar thickness produced in an optimal Ar/O2 ambient, and an ITO ﬁlm produced by a commercial vendor. Reﬂection is shown for ITO ﬁlms but is not available for the IZrO ﬁlm. Comparison illustrates that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar is of good optical quality even when compared to high-quality ITO ﬁlms. 083547-3 Gessert et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 both of the other “optimal” ITO ﬁlms, suggesting that IZrO may have applications in which ﬁlms grown without oxygen are preferred. Based on the indications that Zr is both a reasonable n-type dopant for IO and that IZrO can maintain high ﬁlm transparency at low O2%, ITZO ﬁlms were produced to determine if the optical beneﬁts observed for IZrO could be engineered into a ﬁlm with an electrical quality more consistent with ITO. Figure 4 shows an ITZO and ITO ﬁlm that was produced using high O2% in the sputtering ambient, while Fig. 5 shows a similar pair of ﬁlms produced in a low O2% ambient. Note that these ﬁgures compare ﬁlms that are both of similar thickness and electrical properties i.e., carrier concentrations and mobility, measured using roomtemperature Hall measurements. By selecting ITO and ITZO ﬁlms with this high degree of similarity, differences due to free-carrier absorption can be minimized.6 The comparisons show that the ITZO ﬁlms demonstrate higher transmission than the ITO ﬁlm in both the visible 500–700 nmand NIR spectral region. It is also noted that the difference in NIR transmission of the ITZO ﬁlm is even greater for the ﬁlms with lower carrier concentration shown in Fig. 4. Our suggested reasons for these observations are discussed below. C. SE Drude theory is usually adequate to explain the optical and electrical properties of TCOs. However, the difference in optical transmission shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for ﬁlms with similar carrier concentration and mobility suggests that the details of free-electron absorption as suggested by Drude theory require closer inspection. Figure 6 shows SE analysis indicating the spectral variation for the real part of the dielectric coefﬁcient 1in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The ITO and ITZO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 6 are the same ﬁlms shown in Fig. 4 and have very similar carrier concentration. The SE data were ﬁtted using a linear graded-layer model with ﬁve steps between nodes two or three nodes incorporated, in which the end points were ﬁxed and the complex dielectric coefﬁcient within the central region was allowed to vary. The data shown in Fig. 6 represent 1 at the bottom of the respective ﬁlm stacks i.e., the location near the TCO/glass interface. The SE analysis shows that as Zr is added to the IO host material, 1 increases within the wavelength range probed. This overall increase in 1 with Zr content in this spectral range remains true, regardless of the ﬁlm depth at which 1 is analyzed. IV. DISCUSSION The results above indicate that addition of Zr to IObased TCOs can provide the following beneﬁts compared to ITO: 1for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zrcontaining ﬁlms maintain higher carrier concentration at higher O2%; 2for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zr-containing ﬁlms maintain higher transparency at reduced O2%; and 3Zr-containing ﬁlms demonstrate higher visible and infrared transparency at optimum O2%. The combination of the ﬁrst two beneﬁts presents a compelling pathway toward the production of ITO-like ﬁlms with a wider window for process optimization and reproducibility. The third observation suggests that the addition of Zr has produced a fundamental alteration to the ITO material and that it may be possible to exploit this alteration to improve the performance of TCOs, in general. 80 60 40 20 0 T, R, A (%) 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 Wavelength (nm) ITZO_005 (0.448 μm, 7.92x10 20 cm -3, 35.0 cm 2 V -1sec -1) ITO_004 (0.451 μm, 7.29x10 20 cm -3, 36.9 cm 2 V -1sec -1) R T A FIG. 4.

DOI: 10.1063/1.3116542 I. INTRODUCTION Doped In2O3 IOﬁlms represent some of the highestquality transparent conducting oxides TCOspresently available. Reasons include its ability to maintain high mobility at high carrier concentration and low optical absorption. IO ﬁlms can be doped using several group IVA and IVB dopants, including Ti, Zr IZrO, and Sn In2O3:SnO2 ITO.1 However, most reports suggest that the optimal balance between electrical and optical quality is produced with Sn doping.2 High-quality ITO ﬁlms can be produced by magnetron sputtering using substrate temperatures of 250° –350 °C and an ambient in which the oxygen partial pressure is controlled to yield a slight oxygen deﬁciency in the ﬁlm. However, when the sputter ambient becomes too oxygen deﬁcient, the optical transparency of the ﬁlm decreases. The challenge during ITO deposition is to incorporate enough oxygen to produce ﬁlms with high transparency and optimal electrical properties. In production coating systems, this critical balance of oxygen must be maintained over a large deposition area, and it is often adjusted for variations in target use, seasonal changes, and maintenance activities. Our recent investigations have identiﬁed a method to produce ﬁlms that are similar to ITO but are less sensitive to variations in the oxygen-containing deposition ambient. We have used IO and ITO ceramic sputtering targets that contain a small amount of Zr to produce sputtered ﬁlms on barium borosilicate glass substrates. Electrical and optical analyses of these ﬁlms reveal that an 0.5 at. % addition of Zr to ITO referred to as ITZOallows fabrication of lowresistance ﬁlms at higher oxygen partial pressure and fabrication of higher optical-transmission ﬁlms at lower oxygen partial pressure. The improved optical transmission is especially obvious in the near-infrared NIRspectral region. We believe these beneﬁts may embody advantages for large-area ITO ﬁlm production and could point the way toward similar beneﬁts in other TCOs such as those based on ZnO, SnO2, CdO, and mixed alloys. II. EXPERIMENTAL Films were prepared using radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at 13.56 MHz in a sputter-down conﬁguration from 2 in. planar targets of 99.99% purity. The sourcesubstrate separation was 1.27 cm. Doped targets were fabricated by CERAC, Inc. Milwaukee, WIand were produced by hot pressing followed by ﬁring in oxygen at 760 °C. The undoped IO target was produced by Pure Tech Brewster, NYand was 99.99% pure. The four target compositions compared in this study are shown in Table I. Film deposition was performed in a Uniﬁlm Technologies sputtering system that is capable of automated control of both substrate orbit and rotary motion to enhance deposit uniformity. Base pressures of 510−8–210−7 torr were established using a cryopump maximum speciﬁed throughput =8.9 torr l s−1, Arprior to each deposition. Ultra-highpurity argon 99.999%and oxygen 99.995%were used as the sputtering gases. Gas ﬂows and partial pressure ratio were set using needle valves prior to throttling to the sputtering pressure of 10 mtorr, which was measured with a aElectronic mail: tim_gessert@nrel.gov. TABLE I.

The ratio of oxygen to argon pressure in the sputter ambient is described as O2% using the following relation: O2% = PO2/PAr+ PO2100, 1 where PO2and PArare the oxygen and argon pressures measured with an ion gauge before throttling. Note, because the ionization efﬁciency of Ar is higher than O2, the absolute O2% in the ambient will be higher than the relative O2% indicated by Eq. 1. Sputtering was conducted at constant power of 80 W, and ﬁlms were produced with thicknesses from 100 to 1200 nm. Corning 7059 glass substrates were cleaned using a 5% solution of 18 Mde-ionized water and Citranox in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, followed by rinsing in de-ionized water, spin rinsing to an output water resistivity of 12 M and spin drying. Substrates were placed on a rotatable heater boron-nitride elementoperating at a constant voltage. Depositions were performed at substrate temperatures of 120° –420 °C. The substrate temperature was calibrated in vacuum by placing a 0.32-cm-thick Al block with an embedded thermocouple at the substrate position and allowing the block to equilibrate for 2 h. Following deposition, the samples were maintained in the sputtering ambient and temperature for 1 h, after which the gases and the heater were shut off and the substrate was allowed to cool under vacuum for 1 h. This postdeposition procedure was found to be necessary to achieve reproducibility of ﬁlm electrical parameters. The thickness of the 200–1200 nm ﬁlms was measured using stylus proﬁlometry Veeco Dektak 3, and the 100–200 nm ﬁlms were measured using ellipsometry Rudolph Research Type 43702–200E. Optical measurements were performed using a spectrophotometer Varian Cary 5G in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. The ﬁlm resistivity, mobility, and carrier concentration were obtained at room temperature from Hall analysis using the van der Pauw method BioRad HL5500 System. Spectroscopic ellipsometry SEmeasurements were performed to analyze dielectric constants using a J.A. Woollam M-2000 rotating compensator ellipsometer at three angles of incidence 55°, 60°, and 65°in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The data were analyzed using a three-layer optical model consisting of surface roughness, a graded TCO ﬁlm, and a glass substrate. The TCO ﬁlm was represented by a Drude oscillator to model free-carrier absorption at long wavelengths and by a pole to model dispersion due to absorption at higher energies outside the spectral range. The oscillator parameters were allowed to vary independently at the top and bottom of the TCO ﬁlm and were connected by a multinode linear grading. Surface roughness was modeled as a Bruggeman effective medium approximation of a 50% mixture of voids and TCO material. Layer thicknesses, grading, and optical constant parameters were ﬁt simultaneously over multiple angles and wavelengths for each sample. III. RESULTS A. Electrical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms The material properties of nearly all TCO ﬁlms are known to demonstrate signiﬁcant dependence on substrate temperature and O2%. Previous studies with IO-based materials indicated that optimum material properties are produced at substrate temperatures between 200 and 400 °C.3,4 At these deposition temperatures, O2% is typically optimized at 0.3%.5 Table II shows that results from this work are consistent with these previous studies. The table also provides an indication of material properties for ﬁlms deposited in a relatively “low” versus “high” O2% ambient. Here low and high O2% represents the approximate end points of the optimum range of O2% for each ﬁlm type. For these studies, high O2% leads to higher mobility and lower carrier concentration, whereas low O2% ambient produces lower mobility and higher carrier concentration. Because of the importance of high mobility and low carrier concentration to reduce freecarrier absorption, TCO ﬁlms are often optimized in the high O2% range. For this study, the more important beneﬁt of controlling ﬁlm electrical properties through O2% is that one can produce pairs of ITO and ITZO ﬁlms that demonstrate nearly identical electrical properties. This allows the effect of Zr on optical properties to be assessed separately from the effect that mobility and carrier concentration have on optical properties i.e., Drude theory expectations.6 Table II shows that minimum resistivity in IO ﬁlms results from deposition conditions that produce a carrier concentration in the range of 1019 cm−3 and mobility in the range of 20 cm2 V−1 s−1. The reason for low carrier concentration is likely because donors related either directly or indirectly to oxygen vacancies are not as effective as the group IV substitutional donors i.e., Sn or Zr. The mobility for IO is consistent with other reports, as well as with other undoped TCO thin ﬁlms.7 In contrast, ITO ﬁlms produced during this study had carrier concentrations of 7–15 1020 cm−3, and the highest-mobility ITO ﬁlm demonstrated carrier concentration and mobility of 4.4 1020 cm−3 and 42.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. IZrO ﬁlms demonstrated reasonable direct current electrical properties although poorer than the ITO ﬁlms. Typical TABLE II. Representative deposition parameters and resulting electrical properties for IO-based ﬁlms fabricated during this study. For each ﬁlm type, electrical properties are indicated for both a high and low O2% ambient condition.

J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 carrier concentrations were 0.2–41020 cm3 with mobilities of 7–15 cm2 V−1 s−1. A higher carrier concentration could be expected for the IZrO ﬁlms compared to the ITO ﬁlms because the atomic percent of Zr is higher in the IZrO target than Sn in the ITO target 3.93 at. % versus 3.29 at. %, respectively; see Table I. However, the fact that IZrO ﬁlms demonstrate higher carrier concentration than the IO ﬁlms indicates that Zr is an effective donor in IO-based TCOs. The observation that IZrO did not achieve mobility greater than 15 cm2 V−1 s−1 differs from historic reports in which mobilities approaching 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 are suggested.1 The lower mobility achieved in this study may result from differences in deposition processes and/or analysis. However, another possibility is that the concentration of ZrO2 9 wt % in our targetis excessive and reducing Zr content may lead to increased mobility in IZrO ﬁlms. Another important difference between ITO and IZrO ﬁlms is that the electrical properties of IZrO ﬁlms were found to be much less sensitive to variations in O2%.8 This observation will be discussed more fully below. Electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms were found to be nominally identical to ITO ﬁlms once the effect of O2% ambient is considered. This is consistent with the observation that Zr is an effective dopant in IO and suggests that a small amount of ZrO2 1 wt % ZrO2does not perturb signiﬁcantly the carrier-scattering processes in the predominantly ITO matrix. Similar to ITO, fabrication of ITZO ﬁlms with high electrical quality required a small addition of oxygen to the sputtering ambient 0.5%. Also, similar to the IZrO ﬁlms, and as suggested in Table II, we found that the electrical properties of ITZO ﬁlms can be optimized over a wider range of O2% than ITO ﬁlms. Figure 1 shows that the ITZO ﬁlm maintains a resistivity of 310−4 cm to O2% of 0.7%, whereas the ITO ﬁlm exceeds this resistivity for O2%0.5%. This functionality could provide advantages to large-area production of ITO-like ﬁlms, especially when one considers that variation in O2% can arise from many sources, including wall and sample outgassing, leakage, and seasonal humidity variations.8 As will be shown below, this advantage is leveraged when the optical beneﬁts of Zr addition to ITO are considered. B. Optical properties of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms Figure 2 compares the optical transparency of IO, ITO, IZrO, and ITZO ﬁlms deposited in pure Ar. These ﬁlms were produced to be thicker 0.7–1.2 mthan is typical for many applications to enhance differences in optical transmission. The poor transmission demonstrated by most of the ﬁlms 5%is consistent for TCO ﬁlms sputtered at high temperature in an Ar-only ambient with low base pressure of other impurities base pressure for this study is 5 10−8 torr. In contrast, Fig. 2 shows that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar demonstrates very high transparency 80%. This is true even though this target had been used for numerous prior depositions; therefore, it is unlikely that the higher transmission is due to high but metastableoxygen concentration near the target surface. This difference in transmission suggests that the Zr either facilitates oxygen incorporation into the depositing ﬁlms or changes the material properties such that less oxygen is required to achieve high transparency. Figure 3 compares a thinner IZrO ﬁlm 0.1 mproduced in pure Ar with two ITO ﬁlms produced in optimal O2%. One of the ITO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 3 was produced using the same target used to produce the ITO target shown in Fig. 2, and the other was produced by a commercial vendor.

Figure compares spectral transmission of an IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar, an ITO ﬁlm of similar thickness produced in an optimal Ar/O2 ambient, and an ITO ﬁlm produced by a commercial vendor. Reﬂection is shown for ITO ﬁlms but is not available for the IZrO ﬁlm. Comparison illustrates that the IZrO ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar is of good optical quality even when compared to high-quality ITO ﬁlms. 083547-3 Gessert et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105, 083547 2009 21 October 2024 09:23:37 both of the other “optimal” ITO ﬁlms, suggesting that IZrO may have applications in which ﬁlms grown without oxygen are preferred. Based on the indications that Zr is both a reasonable n-type dopant for IO and that IZrO can maintain high ﬁlm transparency at low O2%, ITZO ﬁlms were produced to determine if the optical beneﬁts observed for IZrO could be engineered into a ﬁlm with an electrical quality more consistent with ITO. Figure 4 shows an ITZO and ITO ﬁlm that was produced using high O2% in the sputtering ambient, while Fig. 5 shows a similar pair of ﬁlms produced in a low O2% ambient. Note that these ﬁgures compare ﬁlms that are both of similar thickness and electrical properties i.e., carrier concentrations and mobility, measured using roomtemperature Hall measurements. By selecting ITO and ITZO ﬁlms with this high degree of similarity, differences due to free-carrier absorption can be minimized.6 The comparisons show that the ITZO ﬁlms demonstrate higher transmission than the ITO ﬁlm in both the visible 500–700 nmand NIR spectral region. It is also noted that the difference in NIR transmission of the ITZO ﬁlm is even greater for the ﬁlms with lower carrier concentration shown in Fig. 4. Our suggested reasons for these observations are discussed below. C. SE Drude theory is usually adequate to explain the optical and electrical properties of TCOs. However, the difference in optical transmission shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for ﬁlms with similar carrier concentration and mobility suggests that the details of free-electron absorption as suggested by Drude theory require closer inspection. Figure 6 shows SE analysis indicating the spectral variation for the real part of the dielectric coefﬁcient 1in the spectral range of 800–1700 nm. The ITO and ITZO ﬁlms shown in Fig. 6 are the same ﬁlms shown in Fig. 4 and have very similar carrier concentration. The SE data were ﬁtted using a linear graded-layer model with ﬁve steps between nodes two or three nodes incorporated, in which the end points were ﬁxed and the complex dielectric coefﬁcient within the central region was allowed to vary. The data shown in Fig. 6 represent 1 at the bottom of the respective ﬁlm stacks i.e., the location near the TCO/glass interface. The SE analysis shows that as Zr is added to the IO host material, 1 increases within the wavelength range probed. This overall increase in 1 with Zr content in this spectral range remains true, regardless of the ﬁlm depth at which 1 is analyzed. IV. DISCUSSION The results above indicate that addition of Zr to IObased TCOs can provide the following beneﬁts compared to ITO: 1for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zrcontaining ﬁlms maintain higher carrier concentration at higher O2%; 2for ﬁlms deposited in similar O2% ambient, Zr-containing ﬁlms maintain higher transparency at reduced O2%; and 3Zr-containing ﬁlms demonstrate higher visible and infrared transparency at optimum O2%. The combination of the ﬁrst two beneﬁts presents a compelling pathway toward the production of ITO-like ﬁlms with a wider window for process optimization and reproducibility. The third observation suggests that the addition of Zr has produced a fundamental alteration to the ITO material and that it may be possible to exploit this alteration to improve the performance of TCOs, in general. 80 60 40 20 0 T, R, A (%) 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 Wavelength (nm) ITZO_005 (0.448 μm, 7.92x10 20 cm -3, 35.0 cm 2 V -1sec -1) ITO_004 (0.451 μm, 7.29x10 20 cm -3, 36.9 cm 2 V -1sec -1) R T A FIG. 4.

Introduction Extensive research interest has focused on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and its tandem devices due to its high efficiency, wide bandgap, and low fabrication cost (Green, 2016). Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) are currently the focus of research studies due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) combined with crystalline silicon (c-Si) (Dewi et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Duong et al., 2017) or chalcogenide solar cells (Han et al., 2018; Bailie et al., 2015). Within the last two years, there have been several encouraging demonstrations of perovskite/silicon tandem devices with a PCE superior to that of their (high-performance) c-Si bottom-cells. Furthermore, the latest record PCE of a perovskite/silicon tandem has reached to a certified 28% (Oxford, 2019), thereby surpassing the bestin-class reported for single-junction c-Si (26.7%) (NREL, 2018). Parasitic absorption in transparent electrodes is one of the main challenges to enableing PCEs for perovskite-based tandem solar cells beyond 30% (Jacobs et al., 2019). Additionally, in devices with soft materials such as perovskite, the high temperatures during deposition and post-annealing may accelerate methylammonium iodide evolution and result in irreversible damage of the perovskite active layer and the organic carrier extraction layers (Loper et al., 2015). Thus, one of the major challenges for ST-PSCs is the availability of suitable transparent electrode material in a low temperature procedure. Importantly, the transparent electrode is not only the first necessary development for a semi-transparent perovskite device, but also the missing building block for the integration in a monolithic device (Loper et al., 2015). Ideally, transparent electrodes feature simultaneously a high lateral conductivity and broadband transparency to minimize resistive losses and to increase the performance throughout the solar spectrum on device level, respectively. Significant efforts have been made (Loper et al., 2015; You et al., 2015), and among them sputtered transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) can be regarded as the ideal candidates because of their high transmittance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.12.040 Received 17 August 2019; Received in revised form 11 December 2019; Accepted 14 December 2019 ⁎ Corresponding author.

T region, low sheet resistance, good chemical stability and process reproducibility (Ellmer, 2012). To fulfill the seemingly contradictive transparency and conductivity requirement, strategies to increase the carrier mobility are required. It is critical that the transparent electrodes should combine a high conductivity with a minimal free-carrier absorption. Losses associated with the parasitic absorption caused by free-carrier can be reduced by decreasing the carrier density of the transparent electrode (Koida et al., 2007). On the other hand, increase in the carrier mobility is required to maintain a high conductivity. Motivated by these criteria, some TCOs based on doped In2O3 have already been explored for tandem solar cells, such as ITO, Zr-doped In2O3 (IZRO) and ITO/H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) bilayer electrodes. In this, ITO, whereas being well established, is of limited appeal because of its low mobility and high parasitic absorption especially in the NIR Fig. 1. (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of ICO and (b) ITO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 410 range (Morales-Masis et al., 2017), or it needs a post-annealing process (at 100 °C for 10–15 min) to enable its mobility > 40 cm2/Vs (Ramos et al., 2018; Bush et al., 2017). IZRO has been explored as another promising TCO with a high mobility and NIR transparency, resulting in improved short circuit current density, compared to ITO in silicon heterojunction solar cells (Morales-Masis et al., 2018) and perovskite/ silicon tandem device (Aydin et al., 2019). Unfortunately, this IZRO still has limitations because of its low mobility as-deposited and need a postannealing process (at 200 °C for 25 min) (Aydin et al., 2019). Conversely, crystalline In2O3:H has a very high mobility and optical transparency (Koida et al., 2007). However, this TCO may degrade the device performance due to water vapor effusion (Koida et al., 2009). Recently, Ce-doped In2O3 (ICO) has been explored as a promising electrode with micro-strain in the vicinity to the dopant sites and density of oxygen vacancies could be reduced by CeO2 doping. With these benefits, excellent optoelectronic properties such as high transparency, wide bandgap (> 3.5 eV), and high conductivity, combined with high NIR transparency were obtained to improve crystallinity at 150 °C by DC arc-discharge ion-plating and post-annealing at 200 °C (Kobayashi et al., 2014; Eiji et al., 2016). Therefore, a procedure at room temperature (RT) makes it competitive for the application in perovskite and its tandem solar cells. In this study, we thoroughly studied the structural and optoelectronic properties of radio frequency (RF) sputtered ICO films, especially at room deposition temperature. Improvements of light transmittance in 300–1800 nm range and carrier mobility are detected in these films deposited at RT compared to a conventional ITO transparent electrode. Each promotion is tested in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and J-V detections. An initial PCE was then measured of more than 14% and 20% respectively to confirm its applicability for high-efficiency ST-PSCs and perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem solar cells. Thus, this high-quality ICO transparent electrode with improved full spectrum performance and carrier mobility at RT make it a promising electrode for perovskite single junction and perovskite-based tandem solar cells. 2. Experimental methods ICO and ITO films about 100 nm ( ± 5 nm) thick were deposited on Eagle XG glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering in a KJLC Lab-18 sputtering system. The source materials for TCO deposition in this study were a ceramic In2O3:CeO2 target (3 wt%) and ceramic In2O3:SnO2 target (10 wt%), respectively. We maintained the sputtering chamber at a base pressure less than 1 × 10−5 Pa before each deposition. The distance between the substrate and target was maintained at 190 mm. We applied both low power density (2.6 W/cm2) and low pressure Fig. 2. Electrical properties of ICO and ITO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 411 (1.5 mTorr) along with pure Ar plasma condition. The substrate temperature varied from RT to 200 °C. We applied the van der Pauw method (Qing et al., 2018) to determine sheet resistance, Hall mobility and carrier concentration at 22 °C in an HL5500 Hall System. Film thicknesses were measured by using a Dektak 3030 profilometer. The crystal orientation was determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) in an X'-Pert PRO system. Moreover, we analyzed the bonding state of the films by using an Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The optical transmittance and reflection spectra of 200–1800 nm were collected by using a UV–Vis-NIR Varian-Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. The cross-section image was obtained by using a ThermoFisher Apreo SEM system. ICO and ITO films were applied as the transparent electrode for STPSCs and perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells, respectively. The structure of single junction ST-PSC is stacked as: ITO-coated glass with sheet resistance of about 10 Ω/sq; 40 nm SnO2 hole-blocking layer; 400 nm FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.25Br0.75 absorber layer; 150 nm Spiro-OMeTAD holetransporting layer; 9 nm MoOx buffer layer; 100 nm ICO (ITO) transparent electrode with shadow masked gold grid electrode. When transformed ITO substrate into c-Si bottom cell with modified tunnel junction, a monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem device was obtained. The detailed preparation process has been reported in our previous works (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). We measured J-V under 1-sun (AM 1.5, 25 °C, 100 mW/cm2) by using a Wacom WXs-156s-l2 dual-beam solar simulator. Simulation of AM1.5 spectrum was conducted through superpositioning the two filtered light sources of the simulator with calibration. The EQE curves were carried out with our assembled system equipped with the dedicated illuminator, monochromator and lock-in amplifier. To get the EQE values in tandem device, monochromatic light sources (700 nm and 400 nm) were provided to bias the top or bottom part. 3. Results and discussion We obtained XRD patterns of ICO and ITO films prepared at different substrate temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1(a), no peaks were observed for ICO films that were deposited below 100 °C. As the substrate temperature increased, the amorphous phase changed to polycrystalline structure, with the most prominent peak of (2 2 2) and weak planes of (2 1 1) and (3 3 2). The prominent (2 2 2) peak maximized intensity at 150 °C, whereas the (2 1 1) peak was inclined to a higher temperature. Additionally, the (2 2 2) peak position had a slight shift as the substrate temperature was increased, indicating variations of the residual stress in these films (Meng and Placido, 2003). Note that no peaks of Ce-oxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 were observed, which implies that the cerium source replaces indium substitutionally. The average crystallite size for (2 2 2) peaks calculated by Scherrer’s formulation (Bender and Douloufakis, 2001) increased initially and then decreased along with the increase in temperature, as the largest grain size of 17.5 nm occurs at 150 °C. For comparison, XRD patterns of ITO films were added in Fig. 1(b). The crystallite tendency bring into correspondence with ICO films. The (2 2 2) preferential orientation appeared at 150 °C, and the intensity significantly lower than ICO films which prepared at the same condition. As all the peak intensities were Fig. 3. XPS spectra of Ce 3d for ICO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 412 normalized in common, these results indicate that the ICO layers had a relatively lower crystallization temperature, when compared to industrial ITO films with optimal crystallization temperature of over 200 °C in a magnetron sputtering procedure (Meng and Santos, 1998). Fig. 2 summarizes the variations of the electrical properties of ICO films deposited at different substrate temperatures. In addition, the electrical properties of ITO films prepared at RT and 200 °C were also compared. The film resistivity (ρ) depends on the concentration (n) and mobility (μ) of relevant free carriers as follows: ρ = (neμ)−1, where e is the electronic charge (Du et al., 2014). Low carrier concentration and high mobility were obtained for the ICO samples deposited at RT. As the carrier concentration decreased from 3.61 × 1020 to 2.11 × 1020 cm−3, the carrier mobility improved from 26.3 to 51.6 cm2/Vs compared to ITO films in our system. Then we compared the binding characteristics of the atoms, which compose the ICO layers to be deposited at a variety of temperatures. The curve-fitted Ce 3d peaks for different samples are shown in Fig. 3. The Ce 3d peak for ICO film was resolved into two Gaussian-Lorentzian components. The high binding-energy peak of 885.4 ± 0.2 eV is associated with Ce3+ ions, which are surrounded by O (or substitutional In) atoms. This result validated the availability of CeeO bonds in the ICO matrix. In comparison, the low binding-energy component at 881.6 ± 0.2 eV was due to the activated Ce4+ ions, which could offer effective donors in the lattice (Watanabe et al., 2009; Bêche et al., 2010). In nominally n-type In2O3, the dopant usually acts as substitutions or interstitials in the lattice. When the radius of dopant atom is approximately equal to that of In atom, the formation of substitution defect is lower as well as interstitial hydrogen could locate between OeIn bonds. When Ce is doped, the CeIn defect will form. If Ce atom could be fully oxidized to form a Ce4+ condition, a remaining free electron will be released into the lattice making the CeIn · act as a benefactor in In2O3 films (Paine et al., 1999). If Ce3+ ion was formed, no more free electron could be offered to increase the carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but makes the lattice distortion. This occurrence implies that CeIn is an efficient defect creator in In2O3 lattice and indirectly reduced the carrier mobility. Therefore, the relative concentrations of Ce4+ (Ce4+ at.%/Ce at.%) and Ce3+ (Ce3+ at.%/Ce at.%) were calculated according to the area of Ce 3d (I) and Ce 3d (II) peaks for ICO films deposited at different substrate temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4, the calculated atomic percentages of Ce related to the active donor (Ce4+) was 32.7% at room-temperature deposition, indicating effective doping at that condition. When the substrate temperature increased, the relative atomic ratio of active Ce4+ and CeIn · increased proportionally. We attribute this decrease in carrier concentration to a reduction in doubly charged oxygen vacancies during the oxidation procedure at a relative high substrate temperature, written as VO ·· in Kröger–Vink notation, which provide as shallow Fig. 4. (a) Transmittance and (b) absorption of ICO and ITO films deposited at RT and 200 °C. Fig. 5. (a) Calculated refractive index n and (b) extinction coefficient k of ICO and ITO thin films deposited at RT. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 413 donors (Tan et al., 2017). Fig. 2 also displays the temperature dependence of the Hall mobility of ICO films that are dominated by ionized impurity scattering and lattice scattering. The crystallization quality improves, so the lattice scattering-which due to optical and acoustical phonons and piezoelectric scattering and is independent of carrier density-was reduced along with the increase in temperature. On the other hand, the ionized impurity scattering decreases which depends on the VO ·· density decreases. On behalf of these two advantages, the maximum of the mobility reached to 84.3 cm2/Vs at 150 °C. Additionally, the carrier mobility of this ICO transparent electrode surpass the recently reported ITO (43 cm2/Vs with a 15 min post-annealing at 100 °C (Bush et al., 2017) and IZRO (maximum at 32 cm2/Vs as-deposited and up to 77 cm2/Vs under a 25 min post-annealing at 200 °C (Meng and Placido, 2003) in perovskite tandem solar cells. Taken together, the lowest migration barriers for oxygen are obtained by diffusion employing the dumbbell and the rotated dumbbell interstitials, which highlights the importance of VO ·· in ICO films. In addition, the carrier concentration and mobility of ICO films is strongly dominated by the density of VO ·· . Moreover, sputtering-deposited ICO films could realize high mobility even when deposited at RT, without subsequent annealing. Finally, the ICO thin films deposited at RT achieved a resistivity enhancement of 12.8% (from 6.58 × 10−4 Ω cm to 5.74 × 10−4 Ω cm) compared to the traditional ITO films. Transmittance and conductivity are two important TCO parameters that can significantly affect the performance of transparent solar cell. High transparency and low absorption in the full spectrum can introduce high Jsc to tandem solar cell by reducing the absorption of parasitic light. As shown in Fig. 4a, the spectral transmittance was illustrated in a wide spectral range (200–1800 nm) and highlighted the difference in the short-wavelength range (400–800 nm) for different samples. The abbreviations of each sample are defined as ICO film deposited at RT (ICO-RT) and 200 °C (ICO-200), ITO film deposited at RT (ITO-RT) and 200 °C (ITO-200). The absorption spectra were calculated from the transmittance and reflection coefficients, as defined as: A = 1 −(R + T), as illustrated in Fig. 4b. The absorption characteristics show that ICO films have lower parasitic absorption loss than ITO in visible and near-infrared range, regardless of deposition temperature. More specifically, we deduced the complex refractive index (n, k) of ICO and ITO films deposited at RT from the reflectance and transmittance measured at normal incidence, as shown in Fig. 5. Extended Cauchy mode has been applied from a theoretical point of view in consideration of the Kramers-Kronig relation (Li and Wu, 2004; Gao et al., 2011). A global optimization procedure has been employed to make the difference between calculated and measured optical characteristics to be minimum. The complex refractive index shows the advantages of ICO films in two aspects. First of all, wavelength-dependent refractive index (n) of ICO is lower than that of ITO in the range of 430–800 nm, which makes better optical matching between MoOx (n ~ 2.2) and air (n ~ 1). The optical refractive index of MoOx used in our structure was also deduced as shown in the blue curve in Fig. 4a, while the calculated optimal matching parameters are shown in purple. Secondly, extinction coefficient (k) possesses a distinct advantage over ITO in the whole wavelength range provides less parasitic absorption. Additionally, all of the samples have a collective absorption tail with high extinction coefficient (k) near the wavelength at 300 nm. The optical band gap of In2O3 films, with a direct transition, is determined by applying the Tauc model, and the Devis and Mott model in the high absorbance region (Patil et al., 2011). In this work, the optical bandgaps extracted from the transmission spectra are 3.61 eV, 3.61 eV, 3.61 eV and 3.66 eV for ICO-RT, ICO-200, ITO-RT, and ITO-200, respectively. In a heavily doped n-type semiconductor, the optical bandgap is a result of carrier concentration and dangling bond density at the forbidden band edge. In the doped In2O3 films, both band-gap renormalization and Burstein–Moss (BM) effect significantly contribute to the determination of blue shift of band gap. Modification of electronic states starts to appear in the crystal format, which is due to the fact that electron concentration is higher than the Mott critical value. The correlated motion of charge carriers and their scattering against ionized impurities leads to band-gap narrowing (BGN). Table 1 illustrates the carrier concentration and bandgap of different samples. The BM effect can be clearly observed as an absorption tail in the near-ultraviolet region appears as a blue-shift for the ITO-200 film with the highest carrier concentration. This phenomenon makes great coordination with the significant decline at the long wavelength range, which is related to the free-carrier absorption caused by surface plasmon polariton. In comparison, the optical band gaps of ICO-200 and ICO-RT samples show an equivalent value when the carrier concentration ranged from 1.37 × 1019 to 3.61 × 1020 cm−3. We attribute this result to the variation of dangling-bond density for different samples. The presence of dislocation, point defect, grain boundary and its strain state result in dangling bond of a semiconductor thin film. The negatively charged oxygen species in the current ICO films are absorbed onto the surface of the grain boundary, performing as the trapping site to generate the potential barriers. The removal of the defects, which act as non-radiative recombination centers, with the rise of temperature, affects the optical constants near the band gap and expands the optical band gap of ICO-200. Most importantly, the transmittance of ICO-RT over the whole visible and near-infrared region-especially in the 400–800 nm regioncovers the absorption section of perovskite absorber layer. T550 and Rsheet values of both ICO and ITO films were specified in Fig. 4a. ICO film exhibits batter optical and electrical performances than ITO film deposited at the same condition. To summarize the transmittance results, we conclude that ICO transparent electrode deposited at RT provides a promising alternative to temperature-sensitive solar cells, such as perovskite or organic solar cells. About 5% average transmittance improvement was obtained on both perovskite sensitive range (from 400 nm to 800 nm, varied from 77.7% to 81.6% with glass substrate) and whole tandem configuration sensitive range (from 400 nm to 1800 nm, varied from 78.5% to 83.5%). Finally, we emphasize the potentially improved conductivity and full-spectrum performance for transparent perovskite and tandem solar cells. Single-junction ST-PSC and perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem solar cells were co-deposited with the ICO or ICO transparent electrode both deposited at RT. The detailed ST-PSC structure is illustrated in Fig. 6a: 40-nm SnO2 as hole-blocking layer; 400-nm FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.25Br0.75 as absorber layer; 150-nm Spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting layer; 9-nm MoOx as damage blocking layer; and 100nm ICO or ITO as transparent electrode; 100 nm Au as grid electrode. Fig. 6b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated ST-PSC with ICO transparent electrode (identified by the red rectangle inside). We conducted the J-V and EQE measurement so as to study the wavelength dependence and electrical performance of the targeted cells. The semi-transparent device with a top electrode area of 6 mm × 11 mm is Table 1 Carrier concentration and bandgap of different samples. Samples ICO-RT ICO-200 ITO-RT ITO-200 Carrier concentration 2.11 × 1020 cm−3 1.37 × 1019 cm−3 3.61 × 1020 cm−3 8.14 × 1020 cm−3 Optical bandgap 3.61 eV 3.61 eV 3.61 eV 3.66 eV S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 414 illuminated through FTO side. Two groups of four cells were carried out with five test points for each cell. Samples in comparison in each group have the same trend of variation, with an average PCE of 12.97% or 14.44% using ITO or ICO as the transparent electrode, respectively. PCE statistics of the ICO- and ITO-based devices are shown in Fig. 6c. The best performers with deviations less than 3% from the average value are shown in Fig. 6d as comparison. We scan the devices in a positive to negative voltage direction with a step size of 50 mV and a delay time between points of 0.2 s. Compared to the ITO-based device, the FF improved from 0.67 to 0.69 where the VOC remained almost identical. Fig. 6.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 415 This could be due to the reduction in ohmic losses at the TCO and TCO/ p-contact. Hysteresis is shown in J-V curves of both ICO and ITO transparent electrode devices. Compared with ITO-based device, no significant difference in J-V curves between FS and RS is observed for ICO-based devices. EQE values shown in Fig. 6(e) were also improved in the whole wavelength range with ICO transparent electrode. And the integrated current density increase from 17.38 mA/cm2 to 18.48 mA/ cm2 while leading a relative increment of 8.96% in PCE (from 13.61% to 14.83%). With the need to be applied in perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem devices, light was then illustrated from the top ICO side. As shown in Fig. 7, the active-area (subtract the shielding area given by Au gird electrode) PCE and integrated current density decreased because of the parasitic absorption in Spiro-OMeTAD layer and the low reflectance at the FTO glass side. However, the influence caused by the optical characteristics of ICO transparent electrode is enhanced as the light just goes through it and then into the whole device. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the EQE values obtained an obviously average increment from 67.2% to 73.0% from 450 to 700 nm, where the average transmittance increases from 77.9% to 82.5% at the same wavelength range. We attribute this improvement to the complex refractive index advantage on both refractive index and extinction coefficient aspects. As a result, the integrated current density increased from 13.63 mA/cm2 to 15.10 mA/ cm2 for the single junction devices with the light illuminated from the ICO/ITO side. Furthermore, the ST-PSC with ICO transparent electrode possessed a high average transmittance of 67.21% at 800–1200 nm, where a good incident light window is provided for single crystal silicon bottom cells. The structure of monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem device was optimized in our laboratory condition as reported in our previous work (Zhu et al., 2018) and shown in Fig. 8a. The SHJ cells are comprised of intrinsic (i-type) a-Si and p-type a-Si layers deposited on the polished ntype c-Si (Eg = 1.1 eV) to form a p/n heterojunction on one side and a back surface field. The thickness of thermal evaporated ITO tunnel junction was set at 80 nm for equilibrium between protection of underlying layers and conductivity of electrode. Ultimately, we obtained monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells with the J-V and EQE curves shown in Fig. 8b and c. Two groups of six cells were also carried out with two test points for each tandem solar cell. PCE statistics of the ICO- and ITO-based tandem devices are shown in Fig. 8b. Samples in comparison in each group have the same trend of variation, and the best performers with deviations less than 5% from the average value are shown in Fig. 8c and d as comparison. The advantages of ICO in electrical and optical characteristics were well reflected in the cells performance. As a result, the maximal initial active-area PCE and integrated current density increased from 18.85% to 20.37% and 15.43 mA/cm2 to 16.29 mA/cm2, respectively, were achieved with ICO transparent electrode applying. The detailed parameters of solar cells with ICO an ITO transparent electrode were illustrated in Table 2. The unsatisfactory result of PCEs is mainly resulted from the current loss induced by the unbalanced absorption between the perovskite top cell and the double-side-polished SHJ bottom cell and the parasitic absorption of Spiro-OMeTAD. The light absorption and transmittance could be further balanced by applying solvent engineering to optimize perovskite films in the tandem devices (Zhu et al., 2018). And we will further modify the rear textured SHJ bottom cell and alternatively hole transporting materials with high transmittance for further improvement in cells performance. The results illustrated in this paper demonstrate that the alternative high-performance ICO thin film with high mobility, low carrier concentration and high transmittance enables the fabrication of high-efficiency semi-transparent perovskite and tandem devices. These permit a further step towards the realization of high PCE tandem solar cells beyond the single-junction silicon cell limit. We will do our best to further exploit the ICO transparent electrode in tandem device applications. 4. Conclusion In summary, using magnetron sputtering at RT, we achieved a highperformance ICO transparent electrode to effectively enhance the electricity and full-spectrum performance of the transparent electrode for high-efficiency ST-PSCs and perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells. A high mobility of 51.6 cm2/Vs as well as a reduced resistivity of 5.74 × 10−4 Ω cm were obtain at RT. The optical transmittance in the entire sensitive wavelength region was improved with an average transmittance boost of 5% compared to ITO films at the 400–1800 nm wavelength range, with more suitable refractive index and lower extinction coefficient. When applied in ST-PSCs and perovskite/ SHJ twoterminal tandem solar cells, the advantages of ICO in electrical and optical characteristics were well reflected in the cells performance. Finally, we have successfully demonstrated the ST-PSC and perovskite/ SHJ solar cell delivering a relative increment in PCE of 8.96% (from 13.61% to 14.83%) and 8.06% (from 18.85% to 20.37%), respectively, when comparing with conventional ITO transparent electrode. These results represent a further step to realize tandem cells transcending the silicon solar cell efficiency limitation. Fig. 7.

Introduction Extensive research interest has focused on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and its tandem devices due to its high efficiency, wide bandgap, and low fabrication cost (Green, 2016). Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) are currently the focus of research studies due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) combined with crystalline silicon (c-Si) (Dewi et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Duong et al., 2017) or chalcogenide solar cells (Han et al., 2018; Bailie et al., 2015). Within the last two years, there have been several encouraging demonstrations of perovskite/silicon tandem devices with a PCE superior to that of their (high-performance) c-Si bottom-cells. Furthermore, the latest record PCE of a perovskite/silicon tandem has reached to a certified 28% (Oxford, 2019), thereby surpassing the bestin-class reported for single-junction c-Si (26.7%) (NREL, 2018). Parasitic absorption in transparent electrodes is one of the main challenges to enableing PCEs for perovskite-based tandem solar cells beyond 30% (Jacobs et al., 2019). Additionally, in devices with soft materials such as perovskite, the high temperatures during deposition and post-annealing may accelerate methylammonium iodide evolution and result in irreversible damage of the perovskite active layer and the organic carrier extraction layers (Loper et al., 2015). Thus, one of the major challenges for ST-PSCs is the availability of suitable transparent electrode material in a low temperature procedure. Importantly, the transparent electrode is not only the first necessary development for a semi-transparent perovskite device, but also the missing building block for the integration in a monolithic device (Loper et al., 2015). Ideally, transparent electrodes feature simultaneously a high lateral conductivity and broadband transparency to minimize resistive losses and to increase the performance throughout the solar spectrum on device level, respectively. Significant efforts have been made (Loper et al., 2015; You et al., 2015), and among them sputtered transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) can be regarded as the ideal candidates because of their high transmittance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.12.040 Received 17 August 2019; Received in revised form 11 December 2019; Accepted 14 December 2019 ⁎ Corresponding author.

T region, low sheet resistance, good chemical stability and process reproducibility (Ellmer, 2012). To fulfill the seemingly contradictive transparency and conductivity requirement, strategies to increase the carrier mobility are required. It is critical that the transparent electrodes should combine a high conductivity with a minimal free-carrier absorption. Losses associated with the parasitic absorption caused by free-carrier can be reduced by decreasing the carrier density of the transparent electrode (Koida et al., 2007). On the other hand, increase in the carrier mobility is required to maintain a high conductivity. Motivated by these criteria, some TCOs based on doped In2O3 have already been explored for tandem solar cells, such as ITO, Zr-doped In2O3 (IZRO) and ITO/H-doped In2O3 (In2O3:H) bilayer electrodes. In this, ITO, whereas being well established, is of limited appeal because of its low mobility and high parasitic absorption especially in the NIR Fig. 1. (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of ICO and (b) ITO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 410 range (Morales-Masis et al., 2017), or it needs a post-annealing process (at 100 °C for 10–15 min) to enable its mobility > 40 cm2/Vs (Ramos et al., 2018; Bush et al., 2017). IZRO has been explored as another promising TCO with a high mobility and NIR transparency, resulting in improved short circuit current density, compared to ITO in silicon heterojunction solar cells (Morales-Masis et al., 2018) and perovskite/ silicon tandem device (Aydin et al., 2019). Unfortunately, this IZRO still has limitations because of its low mobility as-deposited and need a postannealing process (at 200 °C for 25 min) (Aydin et al., 2019). Conversely, crystalline In2O3:H has a very high mobility and optical transparency (Koida et al., 2007). However, this TCO may degrade the device performance due to water vapor effusion (Koida et al., 2009). Recently, Ce-doped In2O3 (ICO) has been explored as a promising electrode with micro-strain in the vicinity to the dopant sites and density of oxygen vacancies could be reduced by CeO2 doping. With these benefits, excellent optoelectronic properties such as high transparency, wide bandgap (> 3.5 eV), and high conductivity, combined with high NIR transparency were obtained to improve crystallinity at 150 °C by DC arc-discharge ion-plating and post-annealing at 200 °C (Kobayashi et al., 2014; Eiji et al., 2016). Therefore, a procedure at room temperature (RT) makes it competitive for the application in perovskite and its tandem solar cells. In this study, we thoroughly studied the structural and optoelectronic properties of radio frequency (RF) sputtered ICO films, especially at room deposition temperature. Improvements of light transmittance in 300–1800 nm range and carrier mobility are detected in these films deposited at RT compared to a conventional ITO transparent electrode. Each promotion is tested in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and J-V detections. An initial PCE was then measured of more than 14% and 20% respectively to confirm its applicability for high-efficiency ST-PSCs and perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem solar cells. Thus, this high-quality ICO transparent electrode with improved full spectrum performance and carrier mobility at RT make it a promising electrode for perovskite single junction and perovskite-based tandem solar cells. 2. Experimental methods ICO and ITO films about 100 nm ( ± 5 nm) thick were deposited on Eagle XG glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering in a KJLC Lab-18 sputtering system. The source materials for TCO deposition in this study were a ceramic In2O3:CeO2 target (3 wt%) and ceramic In2O3:SnO2 target (10 wt%), respectively. We maintained the sputtering chamber at a base pressure less than 1 × 10−5 Pa before each deposition. The distance between the substrate and target was maintained at 190 mm. We applied both low power density (2.6 W/cm2) and low pressure Fig. 2. Electrical properties of ICO and ITO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 411 (1.5 mTorr) along with pure Ar plasma condition. The substrate temperature varied from RT to 200 °C. We applied the van der Pauw method (Qing et al., 2018) to determine sheet resistance, Hall mobility and carrier concentration at 22 °C in an HL5500 Hall System. Film thicknesses were measured by using a Dektak 3030 profilometer. The crystal orientation was determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) in an X'-Pert PRO system. Moreover, we analyzed the bonding state of the films by using an Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The optical transmittance and reflection spectra of 200–1800 nm were collected by using a UV–Vis-NIR Varian-Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. The cross-section image was obtained by using a ThermoFisher Apreo SEM system. ICO and ITO films were applied as the transparent electrode for STPSCs and perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells, respectively. The structure of single junction ST-PSC is stacked as: ITO-coated glass with sheet resistance of about 10 Ω/sq; 40 nm SnO2 hole-blocking layer; 400 nm FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.25Br0.75 absorber layer; 150 nm Spiro-OMeTAD holetransporting layer; 9 nm MoOx buffer layer; 100 nm ICO (ITO) transparent electrode with shadow masked gold grid electrode. When transformed ITO substrate into c-Si bottom cell with modified tunnel junction, a monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem device was obtained. The detailed preparation process has been reported in our previous works (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). We measured J-V under 1-sun (AM 1.5, 25 °C, 100 mW/cm2) by using a Wacom WXs-156s-l2 dual-beam solar simulator. Simulation of AM1.5 spectrum was conducted through superpositioning the two filtered light sources of the simulator with calibration. The EQE curves were carried out with our assembled system equipped with the dedicated illuminator, monochromator and lock-in amplifier. To get the EQE values in tandem device, monochromatic light sources (700 nm and 400 nm) were provided to bias the top or bottom part. 3. Results and discussion We obtained XRD patterns of ICO and ITO films prepared at different substrate temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1(a), no peaks were observed for ICO films that were deposited below 100 °C. As the substrate temperature increased, the amorphous phase changed to polycrystalline structure, with the most prominent peak of (2 2 2) and weak planes of (2 1 1) and (3 3 2). The prominent (2 2 2) peak maximized intensity at 150 °C, whereas the (2 1 1) peak was inclined to a higher temperature. Additionally, the (2 2 2) peak position had a slight shift as the substrate temperature was increased, indicating variations of the residual stress in these films (Meng and Placido, 2003). Note that no peaks of Ce-oxides such as CeO2 and Ce2O3 were observed, which implies that the cerium source replaces indium substitutionally. The average crystallite size for (2 2 2) peaks calculated by Scherrer’s formulation (Bender and Douloufakis, 2001) increased initially and then decreased along with the increase in temperature, as the largest grain size of 17.5 nm occurs at 150 °C. For comparison, XRD patterns of ITO films were added in Fig. 1(b). The crystallite tendency bring into correspondence with ICO films. The (2 2 2) preferential orientation appeared at 150 °C, and the intensity significantly lower than ICO films which prepared at the same condition. As all the peak intensities were Fig. 3. XPS spectra of Ce 3d for ICO films. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 412 normalized in common, these results indicate that the ICO layers had a relatively lower crystallization temperature, when compared to industrial ITO films with optimal crystallization temperature of over 200 °C in a magnetron sputtering procedure (Meng and Santos, 1998). Fig. 2 summarizes the variations of the electrical properties of ICO films deposited at different substrate temperatures. In addition, the electrical properties of ITO films prepared at RT and 200 °C were also compared. The film resistivity (ρ) depends on the concentration (n) and mobility (μ) of relevant free carriers as follows: ρ = (neμ)−1, where e is the electronic charge (Du et al., 2014). Low carrier concentration and high mobility were obtained for the ICO samples deposited at RT. As the carrier concentration decreased from 3.61 × 1020 to 2.11 × 1020 cm−3, the carrier mobility improved from 26.3 to 51.6 cm2/Vs compared to ITO films in our system. Then we compared the binding characteristics of the atoms, which compose the ICO layers to be deposited at a variety of temperatures. The curve-fitted Ce 3d peaks for different samples are shown in Fig. 3. The Ce 3d peak for ICO film was resolved into two Gaussian-Lorentzian components. The high binding-energy peak of 885.4 ± 0.2 eV is associated with Ce3+ ions, which are surrounded by O (or substitutional In) atoms. This result validated the availability of CeeO bonds in the ICO matrix. In comparison, the low binding-energy component at 881.6 ± 0.2 eV was due to the activated Ce4+ ions, which could offer effective donors in the lattice (Watanabe et al., 2009; Bêche et al., 2010). In nominally n-type In2O3, the dopant usually acts as substitutions or interstitials in the lattice. When the radius of dopant atom is approximately equal to that of In atom, the formation of substitution defect is lower as well as interstitial hydrogen could locate between OeIn bonds. When Ce is doped, the CeIn defect will form. If Ce atom could be fully oxidized to form a Ce4+ condition, a remaining free electron will be released into the lattice making the CeIn · act as a benefactor in In2O3 films (Paine et al., 1999). If Ce3+ ion was formed, no more free electron could be offered to increase the carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but makes the lattice distortion. This occurrence implies that CeIn is an efficient defect creator in In2O3 lattice and indirectly reduced the carrier mobility. Therefore, the relative concentrations of Ce4+ (Ce4+ at.%/Ce at.%) and Ce3+ (Ce3+ at.%/Ce at.%) were calculated according to the area of Ce 3d (I) and Ce 3d (II) peaks for ICO films deposited at different substrate temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4, the calculated atomic percentages of Ce related to the active donor (Ce4+) was 32.7% at room-temperature deposition, indicating effective doping at that condition. When the substrate temperature increased, the relative atomic ratio of active Ce4+ and CeIn · increased proportionally. We attribute this decrease in carrier concentration to a reduction in doubly charged oxygen vacancies during the oxidation procedure at a relative high substrate temperature, written as VO ·· in Kröger–Vink notation, which provide as shallow Fig. 4. (a) Transmittance and (b) absorption of ICO and ITO films deposited at RT and 200 °C. Fig. 5. (a) Calculated refractive index n and (b) extinction coefficient k of ICO and ITO thin films deposited at RT. S. An, et al. Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 413 donors (Tan et al., 2017). Fig. 2 also displays the temperature dependence of the Hall mobility of ICO films that are dominated by ionized impurity scattering and lattice scattering. The crystallization quality improves, so the lattice scattering-which due to optical and acoustical phonons and piezoelectric scattering and is independent of carrier density-was reduced along with the increase in temperature. On the other hand, the ionized impurity scattering decreases which depends on the VO ·· density decreases. On behalf of these two advantages, the maximum of the mobility reached to 84.3 cm2/Vs at 150 °C. Additionally, the carrier mobility of this ICO transparent electrode surpass the recently reported ITO (43 cm2/Vs with a 15 min post-annealing at 100 °C (Bush et al., 2017) and IZRO (maximum at 32 cm2/Vs as-deposited and up to 77 cm2/Vs under a 25 min post-annealing at 200 °C (Meng and Placido, 2003) in perovskite tandem solar cells. Taken together, the lowest migration barriers for oxygen are obtained by diffusion employing the dumbbell and the rotated dumbbell interstitials, which highlights the importance of VO ·· in ICO films. In addition, the carrier concentration and mobility of ICO films is strongly dominated by the density of VO ·· . Moreover, sputtering-deposited ICO films could realize high mobility even when deposited at RT, without subsequent annealing. Finally, the ICO thin films deposited at RT achieved a resistivity enhancement of 12.8% (from 6.58 × 10−4 Ω cm to 5.74 × 10−4 Ω cm) compared to the traditional ITO films. Transmittance and conductivity are two important TCO parameters that can significantly affect the performance of transparent solar cell. High transparency and low absorption in the full spectrum can introduce high Jsc to tandem solar cell by reducing the absorption of parasitic light. As shown in Fig. 4a, the spectral transmittance was illustrated in a wide spectral range (200–1800 nm) and highlighted the difference in the short-wavelength range (400–800 nm) for different samples. The abbreviations of each sample are defined as ICO film deposited at RT (ICO-RT) and 200 °C (ICO-200), ITO film deposited at RT (ITO-RT) and 200 °C (ITO-200). The absorption spectra were calculated from the transmittance and reflection coefficients, as defined as: A = 1 −(R + T), as illustrated in Fig. 4b. The absorption characteristics show that ICO films have lower parasitic absorption loss than ITO in visible and near-infrared range, regardless of deposition temperature. More specifically, we deduced the complex refractive index (n, k) of ICO and ITO films deposited at RT from the reflectance and transmittance measured at normal incidence, as shown in Fig. 5. Extended Cauchy mode has been applied from a theoretical point of view in consideration of the Kramers-Kronig relation (Li and Wu, 2004; Gao et al., 2011). A global optimization procedure has been employed to make the difference between calculated and measured optical characteristics to be minimum. The complex refractive index shows the advantages of ICO films in two aspects. First of all, wavelength-dependent refractive index (n) of ICO is lower than that of ITO in the range of 430–800 nm, which makes better optical matching between MoOx (n ~ 2.2) and air (n ~ 1). The optical refractive index of MoOx used in our structure was also deduced as shown in the blue curve in Fig. 4a, while the calculated optimal matching parameters are shown in purple. Secondly, extinction coefficient (k) possesses a distinct advantage over ITO in the whole wavelength range provides less parasitic absorption. Additionally, all of the samples have a collective absorption tail with high extinction coefficient (k) near the wavelength at 300 nm. The optical band gap of In2O3 films, with a direct transition, is determined by applying the Tauc model, and the Devis and Mott model in the high absorbance region (Patil et al., 2011). In this work, the optical bandgaps extracted from the transmission spectra are 3.61 eV, 3.61 eV, 3.61 eV and 3.66 eV for ICO-RT, ICO-200, ITO-RT, and ITO-200, respectively. In a heavily doped n-type semiconductor, the optical bandgap is a result of carrier concentration and dangling bond density at the forbidden band edge. In the doped In2O3 films, both band-gap renormalization and Burstein–Moss (BM) effect significantly contribute to the determination of blue shift of band gap. Modification of electronic states starts to appear in the crystal format, which is due to the fact that electron concentration is higher than the Mott critical value. The correlated motion of charge carriers and their scattering against ionized impurities leads to band-gap narrowing (BGN). Table 1 illustrates the carrier concentration and bandgap of different samples. The BM effect can be clearly observed as an absorption tail in the near-ultraviolet region appears as a blue-shift for the ITO-200 film with the highest carrier concentration. This phenomenon makes great coordination with the significant decline at the long wavelength range, which is related to the free-carrier absorption caused by surface plasmon polariton. In comparison, the optical band gaps of ICO-200 and ICO-RT samples show an equivalent value when the carrier concentration ranged from 1.37 × 1019 to 3.61 × 1020 cm−3. We attribute this result to the variation of dangling-bond density for different samples. The presence of dislocation, point defect, grain boundary and its strain state result in dangling bond of a semiconductor thin film. The negatively charged oxygen species in the current ICO films are absorbed onto the surface of the grain boundary, performing as the trapping site to generate the potential barriers. The removal of the defects, which act as non-radiative recombination centers, with the rise of temperature, affects the optical constants near the band gap and expands the optical band gap of ICO-200. Most importantly, the transmittance of ICO-RT over the whole visible and near-infrared region-especially in the 400–800 nm regioncovers the absorption section of perovskite absorber layer. T550 and Rsheet values of both ICO and ITO films were specified in Fig. 4a. ICO film exhibits batter optical and electrical performances than ITO film deposited at the same condition. To summarize the transmittance results, we conclude that ICO transparent electrode deposited at RT provides a promising alternative to temperature-sensitive solar cells, such as perovskite or organic solar cells. About 5% average transmittance improvement was obtained on both perovskite sensitive range (from 400 nm to 800 nm, varied from 77.7% to 81.6% with glass substrate) and whole tandem configuration sensitive range (from 400 nm to 1800 nm, varied from 78.5% to 83.5%). Finally, we emphasize the potentially improved conductivity and full-spectrum performance for transparent perovskite and tandem solar cells. Single-junction ST-PSC and perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem solar cells were co-deposited with the ICO or ICO transparent electrode both deposited at RT. The detailed ST-PSC structure is illustrated in Fig. 6a: 40-nm SnO2 as hole-blocking layer; 400-nm FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.25Br0.75 as absorber layer; 150-nm Spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting layer; 9-nm MoOx as damage blocking layer; and 100nm ICO or ITO as transparent electrode; 100 nm Au as grid electrode. Fig. 6b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated ST-PSC with ICO transparent electrode (identified by the red rectangle inside). We conducted the J-V and EQE measurement so as to study the wavelength dependence and electrical performance of the targeted cells.

Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 414 illuminated through FTO side. Two groups of four cells were carried out with five test points for each cell. Samples in comparison in each group have the same trend of variation, with an average PCE of 12.97% or 14.44% using ITO or ICO as the transparent electrode, respectively. PCE statistics of the ICO- and ITO-based devices are shown in Fig. 6c. The best performers with deviations less than 3% from the average value are shown in Fig. 6d as comparison. We scan the devices in a positive to negative voltage direction with a step size of 50 mV and a delay time between points of 0.2 s. Compared to the ITO-based device, the FF improved from 0.67 to 0.69 where the VOC remained almost identical. Fig. 6.

Solar Energy 196 (2020) 409–418 415 This could be due to the reduction in ohmic losses at the TCO and TCO/ p-contact. Hysteresis is shown in J-V curves of both ICO and ITO transparent electrode devices. Compared with ITO-based device, no significant difference in J-V curves between FS and RS is observed for ICO-based devices. EQE values shown in Fig. 6(e) were also improved in the whole wavelength range with ICO transparent electrode. And the integrated current density increase from 17.38 mA/cm2 to 18.48 mA/ cm2 while leading a relative increment of 8.96% in PCE (from 13.61% to 14.83%). With the need to be applied in perovskite/SHJ two-terminal tandem devices, light was then illustrated from the top ICO side. As shown in Fig. 7, the active-area (subtract the shielding area given by Au gird electrode) PCE and integrated current density decreased because of the parasitic absorption in Spiro-OMeTAD layer and the low reflectance at the FTO glass side. However, the influence caused by the optical characteristics of ICO transparent electrode is enhanced as the light just goes through it and then into the whole device. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the EQE values obtained an obviously average increment from 67.2% to 73.0% from 450 to 700 nm, where the average transmittance increases from 77.9% to 82.5% at the same wavelength range. We attribute this improvement to the complex refractive index advantage on both refractive index and extinction coefficient aspects. As a result, the integrated current density increased from 13.63 mA/cm2 to 15.10 mA/ cm2 for the single junction devices with the light illuminated from the ICO/ITO side. Furthermore, the ST-PSC with ICO transparent electrode possessed a high average transmittance of 67.21% at 800–1200 nm, where a good incident light window is provided for single crystal silicon bottom cells. The structure of monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem device was optimized in our laboratory condition as reported in our previous work (Zhu et al., 2018) and shown in Fig. 8a. The SHJ cells are comprised of intrinsic (i-type) a-Si and p-type a-Si layers deposited on the polished ntype c-Si (Eg = 1.1 eV) to form a p/n heterojunction on one side and a back surface field. The thickness of thermal evaporated ITO tunnel junction was set at 80 nm for equilibrium between protection of underlying layers and conductivity of electrode. Ultimately, we obtained monolithic perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells with the J-V and EQE curves shown in Fig. 8b and c. Two groups of six cells were also carried out with two test points for each tandem solar cell. PCE statistics of the ICO- and ITO-based tandem devices are shown in Fig. 8b. Samples in comparison in each group have the same trend of variation, and the best performers with deviations less than 5% from the average value are shown in Fig. 8c and d as comparison. The advantages of ICO in electrical and optical characteristics were well reflected in the cells performance. As a result, the maximal initial active-area PCE and integrated current density increased from 18.85% to 20.37% and 15.43 mA/cm2 to 16.29 mA/cm2, respectively, were achieved with ICO transparent electrode applying. The detailed parameters of solar cells with ICO an ITO transparent electrode were illustrated in Table 2. The unsatisfactory result of PCEs is mainly resulted from the current loss induced by the unbalanced absorption between the perovskite top cell and the double-side-polished SHJ bottom cell and the parasitic absorption of Spiro-OMeTAD. The light absorption and transmittance could be further balanced by applying solvent engineering to optimize perovskite films in the tandem devices (Zhu et al., 2018). And we will further modify the rear textured SHJ bottom cell and alternatively hole transporting materials with high transmittance for further improvement in cells performance. The results illustrated in this paper demonstrate that the alternative high-performance ICO thin film with high mobility, low carrier concentration and high transmittance enables the fabrication of high-efficiency semi-transparent perovskite and tandem devices. These permit a further step towards the realization of high PCE tandem solar cells beyond the single-junction silicon cell limit. We will do our best to further exploit the ICO transparent electrode in tandem device applications. 4. Conclusion In summary, using magnetron sputtering at RT, we achieved a highperformance ICO transparent electrode to effectively enhance the electricity and full-spectrum performance of the transparent electrode for high-efficiency ST-PSCs and perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells. A high mobility of 51.6 cm2/Vs as well as a reduced resistivity of 5.74 × 10−4 Ω cm were obtain at RT. The optical transmittance in the entire sensitive wavelength region was improved with an average transmittance boost of 5% compared to ITO films at the 400–1800 nm wavelength range, with more suitable refractive index and lower extinction coefficient. When applied in ST-PSCs and perovskite/ SHJ twoterminal tandem solar cells, the advantages of ICO in electrical and optical characteristics were well reflected in the cells performance. Finally, we have successfully demonstrated the ST-PSC and perovskite/ SHJ solar cell delivering a relative increment in PCE of 8.96% (from 13.61% to 14.83%) and 8.06% (from 18.85% to 20.37%), respectively, when comparing with conventional ITO transparent electrode. These results represent a further step to realize tandem cells transcending the silicon solar cell efficiency limitation. Fig. 7.
